JUDGMENT

__paragraph__
SOWAH, J.A:

__paragraph__
In this judgment the parties will be referred to by their designations at the trial court.

__paragraph__
Upon an application brought by the plaintiff/respondent herein, the trial High Court in a Ruling delivered on 25th June 2014 made an interlocutory injunction order against the defendants who are the appellants herein. The Order which related to the parcel of land in dispute was made subject to an undertaking by the plaintiff to pay damages to the defendants should it turn out at the final determination of the suit that she was not entitled to the Order.

__paragraph__
The brief facts of the case is that the plaintiff sued for declaration of title to a parcel of land approximately 15.03 acres situate at NSUMIA near Nsawam said to have been granted to the company in 2004 by the Oprotee Odum family of Kwateman Adjen Kotoku and duly registered. The plaintiff stated that she had constructed a fence wall and an uncompleted structure and had enjoyed peaceful possession until 2013 when it decided to commence constructing a proposed factory on the land. Members of the defendants’ family and their agents had chased her workers away. Hence plaintiff took out the writ of summons for declaration of title, perpetual injunction and damages for trespass, among other reliefs. In her application for interim injunction which was brought under Order 19 rule 3 and Order 25 rule 1 of C.I. 47, the plaintiff exhibited her indenture registered in 2005 and a site plan of the land.

__paragraph__
On their part the defendants filed an affidavit in opposition in which it was averred that the land was covered by a Deed of Declaration dated 12th March 2004 which was made by their previous head of the Nii Sackey family of Akpadebu. They averred that they had caused a site plan to be prepared which showed that the plaintiff's registered land falls far outside the defendants family land but the fact on the ground was that the plaintiff is physically on the defendants land and had trespassed. In a statement of defence that was subsequently filed, the defendants counter-claimed for declaration of title to a parcel of land measuring 180.93 acres, recovery of possession, damages for trespass and perpetual injunction.

__paragraph__
In his Ruling the trial judge considered the submissions in the respective statements of case filed by the parties, the applicable principles and case law and concluded that he was satisfied that a case had been made for a grant of interlocutory injunction. However in order to safeguard the interests of the defendants and in accordance with Order 25 rule 9 of C.I. 47, he made the Order subject to an undertaking by the plaintiff to pay the defendants damages should it turn out at the final determination of the suit that the Order was not justified.

__paragraph__
Dissatisfied with the decision, the defendants filed this Interlocutory appeal on 7th July 2014 seeking to set aside that Ruling. The grounds of appeal are:

__paragraph__
1.The trial judge erred when he did not fully appreciate the defendants/appellants exhibit which showed that the plaintiff’s land was different from the defendants/appellants land.

__paragraph__
2.The trial judge erred when he granted the motion for interlocutory injunction.

__paragraph__
The defendants’ counsel argued the two grounds together in his written submissions. He referred to Vanderpuye vs. Nartey \[1977\] 1 GLR 428, and Anaman vs. Osei Tutu \[1976\] 1 GLR 111 on the general principles and test for the grant of interim injunctions. He contended that the documents exhibited to the defendants’ affidavit in opposition including an official search Report at page 37 of the Record sufficiently showed that the land the plaintiff was claiming lay within the defendants Deed of Declaration whilst there was no recorded transaction of the plaintiff’s purported land. That the land being claimed by the plaintiff was different from plaintiff's land on her own site plan are not the same.

__paragraph__
He submitted that on the authority of Anane vs Donkor \[1965\] GLR 188, a claim for declaration of title or an order for injunction must always fail if the plaintiff failed to establish positively the identity of the land claimed with the land the subject matter of the suit.

__paragraph__
In his response plaintiff's counsel submitted that the trial judge had applied the correct principles and exercised his discretion properly in granting the interlocutory injunction. The court, taking note that the defendants had nothing on the land, had weighed the balance of convenience and the need to preserve the status quo. He relied on the following authorities:

__paragraph__
\-Peterson vs. Charles Kusi \[2010\] 26 GMJ 83 at 85 C.A.

__paragraph__
\-Odonkor vs. Amartei \[1987-1988\] 1 GLR 578 S.C.

__paragraph__
\-Frimpong vs. Nana Asare Obeng ll \[1974\] 1 GLR 16

__paragraph__
The guiding principle for the grant of interlocutory injunction as enacted in Order 25 rule 1 (1) of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules 2004, C.I. 47 is that the Court may grant an injunction in all cases in which it appears to the Court to be just or convenient to do so. Although discretionary, there are settled principles for the grant of injunctions.

__paragraph__
There are numerous authorities on the principles or tests that the court must apply in determining whether an applicant is entitled to the Order. Among the notable cases are Vanderpuye vs. Nartey \[supra\]and Pountney vs. Doegah \[1987-88\] 1 GLR 111. In both of these cases the Court of Appeal applied American Cyanamid Company vs. Ethicon Limited \[1975\] AC 396.These two cases held that the governing principle is whether on the face of the affidavits there is need to preserve the status quo in order to avoid irreparable damage to the applicant, provided his case was not frivolous or vexatious.

__paragraph__
If a legal right could be asserted either at law or in equity, the court could grant an injunction in protection of that right. The rule does not require an applicant to establish a prima facie case. As was noted by Koranteng-Addow J in Musicians Union Of Ghana vs. Abraham \[1982-83\] 1 GLR 337, the courts have moved from the old stand of insisting on the applicant establishing a prima facie case, to a stand where the balance of convenience was the factor which (in a long measure) weighed most with the court, once the court was satisfied that the applicant's case was not frivolous and vexatious and also was one in which damages could not be an adequate alternative remedy.

__paragraph__
Also as held by the Supreme Court in Odonkor vs. Amartei \[supra\] the basic purpose of interim orders was, as much as possible, to hold the balance evenly between the parties, pending a final resolution of matters in difference between them, and also to ensure that at the end of the day the successful party did not find that his victory was an empty one. It is granted where the violation of the right cannot be adequately compensated in damages at the end of the litigation

__paragraph__
It is clear to see that the defendants counsel has misapprehended the ratio of the cases he cited in his submissions, especially the ratio in holding 2 of Vanderpuye vs. Nartey. That case did not uphold that an applicant must establish a prima facie case before he can be granted an interlocutory injunction, but rather the traditional view that the court must abstain from expressing an opinion upon the merits of the case until the hearing. What their Lordships said was this:

__paragraph__
“The requirement that an applicant for interlocutory relief should show a prima facie case was apparently a recent development in the English courts as a manner for disposing of certain types of claim in Chancery. For the traditional view for the grant or refusal of interlocutory relief had been, for the court to abstain from expressing an opinion upon the merits of the case until the hearing, but to minimise the sum total of irreparable damage to the litigants.

__paragraph__
Their Lordships were more direct in Pountney vs. Doegah. They stated clearly that there was no requirement for an applicant whose case was not frivolous; who had a legal or equitable right to be protected, to establish a prima facie case before the court could grant an injunction in protection of that right.

__paragraph__
See also Owusu vs. Owusu \[2007-2008\] 1 SCGLR 870 where the Supreme Court per Adinyira JSC reiterated the need to avoid making a pronouncement on the merits of the case in an application for interlocutory injunction.

__paragraph__
The conclusions of the defendants counsel that the land in dispute falls within the defendants land and the defendants have an iron clad case is therefore premature considering that the pleadings makes this one of the main issues in contention.

__paragraph__
Clearly from the plaintiff's claim and the affidavits and exhibits filed in respect of the Motion, the plaintiff's case was not frivolous. She was asserting a right at law and to that end had exhibited a purported indenture made in 2004. It is worthy of note that the defendants registered Deed of Declaration was also purportedly made in 2004. However, as noted by the trial judge, the acquisition by the plaintiff's vendor was in 2001. The contention of the defendants that the plaintiff had not exhibited any recorded transaction in respect of the land is therefore not accurate.

__paragraph__
The defendants also conceded that the plaintiff had commenced development on the land. This admitted fact called into play a consideration of the balance of convenience. In his Ruling the trial judge gave his reasons for the exercise of his discretion in plaintiff's favour. He considered the relative strengths of the parties’ cases and whether damages would afford adequate compensation. He applied those principals to the facts and circumstances of the case. He then considered whether it would be just and convenient to grant the order, cautioning himself of the need to avoid making a pronouncement on the merits of the case. His conclusion was that as between the parties it was the plaintiff who would suffer hardship as against the defendants whose main concern was the alleged unlawful invasion of their land

__paragraph__
It is trite that judicial discretion cannot be fettered so long as it is exercised judicially in accordance with settled principles, having regard to the facts and the surrounding circumstances of each case and guided by principles of justice and fairness. There are no fixed rules for its exercise and each case must be decided on its own merits.

__paragraph__
We are of the view that the application had merit and the trial judge properly exercised his discretion in granting the application. We have found no cause to interfere.

__paragraph__
It is for the above reasons that the appeal fails and is hereby dismissed.
