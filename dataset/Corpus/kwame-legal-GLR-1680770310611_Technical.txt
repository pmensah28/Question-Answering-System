__paragraph__
On 20 July 1971, the respondents, principal shareholders of Timber and Transport Co., Ltd. (T. & T. Co., Ltd.) entered into a written agreement with a Yugoslav company whereby the respondents agreed to transfer part of their shareholding in T & T Co., Ltd. to the Yugoslav firm, which for its part agreed to invest in and manage the company. It was further agreed that the name of T. & T. Co., Ltd. should be re-named: T. & T. Kumasi-Krusevac Co., Ltd. Clause 15 of the agreement provided that the agreement should remain irrevocable for ten years, and no member or director of the company as re-named could present \[p.371\] a petition or make an application to the court seeking the winding-up or the liquidation or in any way seek or attempt to bring the existence of the company to an end. Despite the existence of clause 15, the petitioners petitioned for the official winding-up of the company, and the appointment of the Registrar of Companies as the provisional liquidator. At the hearing of the petition, counsel for the respondents raised a preliminary objection as to whether having regard to clause 15 of the agreement, the petition was competent.

__paragraph__
Held, upholding the preliminary objection: the law was clear that every contract was prima facie permanent and irrevocable, and it lay upon a person who said that it was revocable or determinable to show either some expression in the contract itself or something in the nature of the contract from which it was reasonable to be implied that it was not intended to be permanent and perpetual, but was to be in some way or other subject to determination. In the present case, the effect of clause 15 then was that a period of at least ten years must elapse before any of the parties to the agreement could apply to the court under Act 180, s. 4 (1) for the official winding-up of the company. It was not the court which said that the petitioner should not come before it until after the expiration of ten years; the parties themselves had so agreed. Since the petitioners were content to enter into the contract upon that footing, they could not complain if the respondents held them to their bargain.

JUDGMENT OF AMUA-SEKYI J.

__paragraph__
This is a petition for the official winding-up of a limited liability company called Timber & Transport Kumasi-Krusevac Ltd. The original name of the company which was formed \[p.372\] in 1966, was Timber & Transport Co., Ltd. On 20 July 1971, Timber & Transport Co., Ltd., its principal shareholders, Osei Bonsu Snr. and Osei Bonsu Jnr., entered into a written agreement with a Yugoslav company, Sumsko-Industrijski Kombinat �Crvena Zastava� or the �Red Flag� Timber Industrial Combine, whereby the Osei Bonsus agreed to transfer part of their shareholding in Timber & Transport Co., Ltd. to the Yugoslav company which, for its part, agreed to invest in and manage the company. It was further agreed that the name of the company would be changed to its present form, the town of Krusevac being the situation of the registered office and the principal place of business of the Yugoslav company.

__paragraph__
The affidavit attached to the petition shows that the Yugoslav company took up its shares, invested U.S. $250,000 as equity share capital, appointed a new managing director and brought over from Yugoslavia a number of experts to assist in running the joint enterprise. The name of the company was on 1 September 1971 changed to its present form. From that moment, it could be said that the fundamental obligations assumed by the parties under the agreement had been performed, and that to that extent the contract was discharged by performance. In so far as anything more remained to be done, clause 16 provided that the agreement should take precedence over and prevail against the regulations of Timber & Transport Co., Ltd. wherever the two were in conflict, and it was further directed that a resolution to that effect be passed by the board of directors of Timber & Transport Kumasi-Krusevac Ltd. and registered along with a copy of the agreement with the Registrar of Companies.

__paragraph__
Differences having arisen between the parties to the agreement, the Osei Bonsus have caused a writ to be issued in this court against the �Red Flag� Timber & Industrial Combine claiming the following reliefs:

__paragraph__
�(a) Rescission of the contract dated 20 July 1971;

__paragraph__
(b) Declaration that the said contract is discharged; or

__paragraph__
(c) Damages for breach of the said contract.�

__paragraph__
The writ and statement of claim are attached to this petition as exhibits 00.10 and 00.11. The answer of the Yugoslav company is this petition for the official winding-up of Timber & Transport Kumasi-Krusevac Ltd. On 12 February 1979, this court heard and granted an ex parte application filed on behalf of the Yugoslav company for the appointment of the Registrar of Companies as provisional liquidator under section 4 (7) of the Bodies Corporate \[p.373\] (Official Liquidations) Act, 1963 (Act 180), and for an appropriate injunction.

__paragraph__
On the hearing of the petition itself, Mr. Kom, counsel for the respondents, has raised as a preliminary point, the question whether having regard to clause 15 of the agreement, the petition is competent. Clause 15 provides:

__paragraph__
�Upon coming into force and effect as aforesaid, this agreement shall be and remain irrevocable for ten years, and accordingly no member or director of the new company may, during the term of ten years immediately following upon coming into force of this agreement, present a resolution to the board of directors or an application to court, seeking the liquidation or winding-up whether voluntary or involuntary of the new com- pany or in any way seek or attempt to bring the existence of the new company to an end. After the expiration of the said ten years this agreement shall continue in force from year to year, and any member or director of the new company who then desires to bring the existence of the new company to an end shall give in writing not less than one year's notice to the board of directors of any step he intends to take for achieving that desire.� There is no room for argument that by clause 15 the parties to the agreement bound themselves not to seek either in court or elsewhere the winding-up of the company as re-constituted until after the expiration of a period of at least ten years.

__paragraph__
Mr. Reindorf, counsel for the petitioners, however, contends that clause 15 is void because it contravenes the Companies Code, 1963 (Act 179) and the Bodies Corporate (Official Liquidations) Act, 1963 (Act 180). Of the various cases cited by him only In re Peveril Gold Mines, Ltd. \[1898\] 1 Ch. 122, C.A. need be considered in some detail. In that case, a motion was brought on behalf of two of the shareholders of the company to stay proceedings upon a petition for the compulsory winding-up of the company. The petition had been presented by a shareholder holding 5,000 fully-paid shares. One of the two shareholders held 20 shares, on which 16s. 6d. per share had been paid, and the other held 13,600 fully-paid shares. All the shares were of the nominal value of �1 each. It was conceded for the purposes of the motion that the petitioner was a contributory who would be entitled to petition, but for clause 164 of the articles of association, which provided:

__paragraph__
�No petition shall be presented or proceeded with by a member to wind up the company, except and unless (a) by consent in \[p.374\] writing of not less than two of the then board, or (b) in pursuance or by permission of a resolution passed by a majority at a general meeting of the company, or (c) the petitioner or petitioners shall hold, or together hold, not less than one-fifth of the then issued capital of the company, upon which all calls shall have been paid.�

__paragraph__
It was admitted that the petitioner had not complied with any one of the conditions mentioned in the clause.

__paragraph__
The motion came before Byrne J. He was of the view that although section 82 of the Companies Act, 1862 (25 & 26 Vict., c. 89), laid it down that a contributory �may� present a petition, it conferred a right upon every shareholder just as much as if the terms of the section had been that every contributory should have �the right to present a petition.� He held that the terms of the section were intended to confer a right of which a contributory could not be deprived, either entirely or in a modified way, by the terms of the articles of association. At p. 123 he said:

__paragraph__
�The memorandum and the articles of association embody the contract between the different members of the company, but those documents must not conflict with the provisions of the Acts regulating the incorporation of joint stock companies.�

__paragraph__
And he continued at pp. 124-126:

__paragraph__
�. . . the question really is, whether or not the petitioner has by becoming a shareholder entered into a contract, enforceable either by the company or by other individual shareholders, not to exercise the right which s. 82 prima facie in terms confers upon him . . . The article which I have to deal with is really an attempt to fix upon the holder of every share an obligation, so to speak, running with the share, in contravention of the provisions of the Act of Parliament . . . If the articles are to be regarded as part of the terms of the contract between the company and the person applying for shares, I am of opinion that the company had no right, having regard to the Act of Parliament, to enter into such contract as a condition and part of the general contract binding upon all shareholders, whatever separate or distinct bargain they might have the power to make with an individual who happened to be or to desire to become a shareholder.�

__paragraph__
On appeal to the Court of Appeal the decision by Byrne J. was affirmed. At. p. 131 Lindley M. R. said:

__paragraph__
�Any one who is familiar with the Companies Acts knows perfectly well that these registered limited companies are \[p.375\] incorporated on certain conditions; they continue to exist on certain conditions; and they are liable to be dissolved on certain conditions. The important sections of the Act of 1862, with regard to dissolution, are ss. 79 and 82. Sect. 79 states the circumstances under which such a company may be dissolved by the Court, and s. 82 states the persons who may petition for a dissolution. Any article contrary to these sections�any article which says that the company is formed on the condition that its life shall not be terminated when any of the circumstances mentioned in s. 79 exist, or which limits the right of a contributory under s. 82 to petition for a winding-up, would be an attempt to enforce on all the shareholders that which is at variance with the statutory conditions, and is invalid.�

__paragraph__
At p. 132 Chitty L.J. said:

__paragraph__
�In my opinion, this condition is annexed to the incorporation of a company with limited liability�that the company may be wound up under the circumstances, and at the instance of the persons, prescribed by the Act, and the articles of association cannot validly provide that the shareholders, who are entitled under s. 82 to petition for a winding-up, shall not do so except on certain conditions.�

__paragraph__
However, like Byrne J., the Court of Appeal left open the question whether the company, or for that matter the shareholders among themselves, could enter into an agreement outside the regulations waiving or limiting a shareholder's statutory right to petition for the official winding-up of the company. At p. 131 Lindley M. R. said: �I do not intend to decide whether a valid contract may or may not be made between the company and an individual shareholder that he shall not petition for the winding-up of the company. That point does not arise now.� And Chitty L.J. also said at pp. 131-132: �We have not now to consider whether an individual shareholder can or cannot bind himself not to petition for the winding-up of the company.�

__paragraph__
In the earlier case of Welton v. Saffery \[1897\] A.C. 299 the House of Lords had agreed that what may not be made a regulation of the company binding upon all present and future members of the company may be made the subject of a private bargain between individual members among themselves. In the words of Lord Davey at p. 331:

__paragraph__
�Of course, individual shareholders may deal with their own interests by contract in such way as they may think fit. But such \[p.376\] contracts, whether made by all or some only of the shareholders, would create personal obligations, or an exceptio personalis against themselves only, and would not become a regulation of the company, or be binding on the transferees of the parties to it, or upon new or non-assenting shareholders.�

__paragraph__
The respondents have been at pains to point out that the agreement of 20 July 1971 was prepared by counsel for the petitioners. I can well imagine the petitioners as investors wanting some assurance that the agreement would be given a reasonable span of life to enable them make a success of the joint venture. Now, however, they say that clause 15 contravenes section 4 (1) of Act 180, and is therefore void. Section 4 (1) provides:

__paragraph__
�4. (1) The Registrar or any person who is,

__paragraph__
(a) a creditor of the company,

__paragraph__
(b) a member or contributory of the company, or

__paragraph__
(c) the Attorney-General, but only on the ground specified in paragraph (c) of subsection (2) of this section, may present a petition to the Court for the official winding-up of the company.� If, following In re Peveril (supra), we read �may present a petition to the Court� to mean �have a right to present a petition to the Court,� the question still remains whether it was open to the parties to the agreement to say, in effect, that that agreement was to remain irrevocable for a period of ten years. In my opinion it was. The agreement bound only the parties to it. Even if a copy was lodged with the Registrar of Companies it did not become part of the regulations of the company binding upon any existing or subsequent shareholder who did not give his individual assent to it. Unlike the clause in question in In re Peveril (supra) clause 15 was not, to quote Byrne J. again at p. 125, �an attempt to fix upon the holder of every share an obligation, so to speak, running with the share� in contravention of the provisions of Act 180, but part of a private agreement outside the machinery of the Companies Code, 1963 (Act 179).

__paragraph__
The law is clear that every contract is prima facie permanent and irrevocable and it lies upon a person who says that it is revocable or determinable to show either some expression in the contract itself, or something in the nature of the contract, from which it is reasonably to be implied that it was not intended to be permanent and perpetual, but was to be in some way or other subject to determination: see Llanelly Railway & Dock Co. v. London & North-Western Railway Co. (1873) 8 Ch.App. 942 at pp. 949-950 per \[p.377\] James L.J. The effect of clause 15, then, is that a period of at least ten years must elapse before any of the parties to the agreement can apply to the court under Act 180, s. 4 (1) for the official winding-up of the company. Here, if I may borrow the words of the Earl of Reading C.J. in Eaglesham v. McMaster \[1920\] 2 K.B. 169, it is not the court which says that the petitioners shall not come before it until after the expiration of ten years; the parties themselves have so agreed. Since the petitioners were content to enter into the contract upon that footing they cannot complain if the respondents hold them to their bargain.

__paragraph__
It may well be that the action commenced by the Osei Bonsus cannot succeed without a winding-up order being made, but as far as the objection taken by Mr. Kom to these proceedings is concerned, I am of the view that it is unanswerable and must be upheld. The application for the official winding-up of the company is accordingly dismissed, and the interim orders made by this court on 12 February 1979 are discharged.

HEADNOTES

__paragraph__
The applicant brought this application for the grant of letters of administration with the will of his father E annexed. E by his will appointed one A as the sole executor and devised his whole estate to the applicant. A entered upon and managed the estate without taking out probate. The executor A, however, died in 1976 and the applicant applied for the grant of letters of administration. Before the grant could be made, M and S caveated the grant of letters to the applicant. M claimed that as the head of the family and successor to the late E, he was entitled to be granted the letters of administration jointly with the applicant. But when it became clear that unlike a situation of death intestate, a grant of letters of administration with will annexed might be made to a devisee of the whole estate without the concurrence or joinder of the head of family, he discontinued his claim. S. however, caveated and in her affidavit claimed that a building and the land around it which were devised to the applicant were her \[p.810\] ancestral family properties and therefore the testator had no legal title in them to clothe anyone with. The applicant and S., the caveatrix, failed to come to an agreement as to the person or persons to whom a grant should be made. And on the issue whether the court was bound to order the applicant to issue a writ of summons against the caveatrix,

__paragraph__
Held, granting the application:

__paragraph__
(1) the decision that whenever a caveat was filed and the caveator failed to come to an agreement with the applicant, the court must order the applicant to issue a writ of summons against the caveator did not meet the ends of justice; it put a restrictive interpretation on Order 60, r. 21 (2) of L.N. 140A of 1954. It was only when the caveator had established an interest, disclosed by his affidavit of interest, that it became obligatory for a judge to order a writ of summons to be issued by the applicant against the caveator. In the instant case, no such interest had been shown by the caveatrix. Dicta of Archer J.A. in In re Arthur (Decd.); Abakah v. Attah-Hagan \[1972\] 1 G.L.R. 435 at p. 447, C.A.; of Lord Selborne in Julius v. Oxford (Bishop of) (1880) 5 App.Cas. 214 at p. 235, H.L. and Sheffield Corporation v. Luxford \[1929\] 2 K.B. 180 applied. Nimoh v. Acheampong \[1959\] G.L.R. 49, S.C. criticised.

__paragraph__
(2) If the property claimed by the caveatrix did not belong to the testator, the devise in the will would not confer any interest in the property on the beneficiary; for the legal interest in the property would not be affected by the grant of letters of administration to the applicant. Since the caveatrix claimed one small property out of several others devised to the applicant, she could therefore not claim to have the better right to the grant of letters of administration. The issue arising between the caveatrix and the applicant was who was entitled to the legal title to the property claimed. That issue could not be determined in an action for letters of administration.

JUDGMENT OF ROGER KORSAH J.

__paragraph__
The applicant�s father died about fifteen years ago. By his will dated 12 April 1947 he appointed one Emmanuel Kofi \[p.811\] Agyepong of Abuakwa Kumasi, as his sole executor, and devised the whole of his estate to the applicant. The executor entered upon the estate and managed it without taking out probate. With his neglect of the farms comprising part of the estate, the said farms reverted to fallow land. Emmanuel Kofi Agyepong, the executor, died in or around 1976, and on 19 August 1977 the applicant filed an ex parte application for the grant of letters of administration with the will of Paul Ennin annexed. Notices pending the grant were duly filed in compliance with the orders of this court.

__paragraph__
On 20 June 1979, before any grant could be made by the court, two persons: Opanin Kwabena Mmire and Madam Amma Serwaah both of Abuakwa, Kumasi, jointly caveated the grant of letters to the applicant. The caveator and caveatrix filed their separate affidavits of interest in response to the warning issued by the applicant.

__paragraph__
The caveator claims that he is the head of family and the present successor to late Paul Ennin and that the applicant should at least have joined him in the application for the grant of letters of administration. But his claim was not pressed to conclusion when it was pointed out that, unlike the case of a death intestate, a grant of letters of administration with will annexed may be made to a devisee of the whole estate without the concurrence or the joinder of the head of family, particularly as he has no interest whatsoever in the estate.

__paragraph__
The claim of the caveatrix was another matter. Her claim was that a building which was devised by the late Paul Ennin and the plot of land around it were the ancestral properties of her family and that Paul Ennin had no legal estate in them to clothe anyone with.

__paragraph__
The applicant moved the court to grant letters of administration with will annexed to him. He, the applicant, and the caveatrix failed to come to an agreement as to the person or persons to whom a grant should be made. The High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 1954 (L.N. 140A), Order 60, r. 21 (2) provides:

__paragraph__
�(2) Failing the parties coming to such an agreement, however the Court may order that the applicant do issue a writ of summons against the caveator within a specified period from the date of such order, to determine the issue as to who is entitled to a grant of probate or letters of administration, as the case may be.�

__paragraph__
(The emphasis is mine.) This rule received interpretation in Nimoh v. Acheampong \[1959\] G.L.R. 49, S.C. In that case, two caveators failed to come to agreement with the appellant for letters of administration as to the person or persons to whom a grant should be made. When the applicant�s motion came on, the judge, pronouncing \[p.812\] that on the affidavits, it was clear that the first caveator had no locus standi and that his intervention was �a bare-faced try-on,� ordered that joint letters of administration should issue to the applicant and the second caveator. On appeal by the first caveator, them Supreme Court per van Lare Ag.C.J. said at p. 50:

__paragraph__
�The Court was therefore bound under the provision of Order 60, Rule 21 (2) of L.N. 140A to order the applicant to issue a writ of summons against the caveators within a specified period. Instead of proceeding as required by the Rules the learned judge ordered Letters of Administration to issue jointly to the applicant and the second caveator.�

__paragraph__
The court therefore set aside the order appealed from.

__paragraph__
This decision means that whenever a caveat is filed and the caveator fails to come to an agreement with the applicant, even though it may be clear from the affidavit of interest that the caveator has no interest in the estate, the court must order the applicant to issue a writ of summons against the caveator. Thus �the court may order� in Order 60, r. 21 (2) was interpreted to mean �the court shall order.� Unfortunately, the judgment is very short and does not contain the reasoning by which the decision was arrived at, that the word �may� should be interpreted as �shall.� This interpretation has been the subject of justifiable criticism by Archer J.A. in the case of In re Arthur (Decd.); Abakah v. Attah-Hagan \[1972\] 1 G.L.R. 435 at p. 447, C.A. Admittedly, the word �may� is permissive and empowering but has sometimes been construed as obligatory. As Lord Selborne said in Julius v. Oxford (Bishop of) (1880) 5 App.Cas. 214 at p. 235. H.L.:

__paragraph__
�The question whether a Judge, or a public officer, to whom a power is given by such words, is bound to use it upon any particular occasion, or in any particular manner, must be solved aliunde, and, in general, it is to be solved from the context, from the particular provisions, or from the general scope and objects, of the enactment conferring the power.�

__paragraph__
In fact, the whole scope and intention of the provision must be considered and there is no cut and dried rule by which the distinction between discretion and obligation can be drawn. So in Sheffield Corporation v. Luxford \[1929\] 2 K.B. 180 it was held that by section 138 of the English County Courts Act, 1888, �may order� are enabling words, but where a legal right to possession has been established on the part of the landlord, it is the duty of the judge to make an order for possession.

__paragraph__
\[p.813\]

__paragraph__
What then is the general scope of the objects of the rules in relation to caveats? The first sentence in Order 60, r. 17 states that "A caveat may be entered by any person having an interest in the estate of a deceased . . .� (The emphasis is mine.) If a person who has no interest whatsoever in the estate of a deceased person were to file a caveat, would a judge be bound to order the applicant for a letters to issue a writ of summons merely because the caveator refuses to agree that he has no interest? Again Order 60, r. 19 enjoins the caveator to file an affidavit of interest. What is the purpose of filing an affidavit of interest if the court, even though the affidavit discloses no interest in the estate of the deceased, is bound to order the applicant to issue a writ of summons against the caveator? In my view, an affidavit of interest is filed to enable the court to determine whether the caveator has any interest in the estate. And the court may make an order dependent upon whether or not the caveator has disclosed in his affidavit an interest in the property of the deceased.

__paragraph__
Finally, under Order 60, r. 21 (2) the writ of summons is issued against the caveator for the resolution of only one issue: �to determine the issue as to who is entitled to a grant of probate or letters of administration, as the case may be.� If by the affidavit of interest it can be ascertained that the caveator has no interest, is it reasonable to expect a court to make an order which will lead to a protracted trial the conclusion of which is already known? As in Sheffield Corporation v. Luxford (supra), it is only when the caveator has established an interest in the estate of the deceased, that it becomes obligatory for a judge to order that a writ of summons be issued by the applicant against the caveator. In my view, the ends of justice cannot be met by putting such a restrictive interpretation on Order 60, r. 21 (2) as was done in the Nimoh case.

__paragraph__
As Archer J.A. said in the In re Arthur case at p. 447 after giving good and substantial reasons:

__paragraph__
�I do not think that the word �may� in the rule \[i.e. Order 60, r. 21 (2)\] should be strictly construed as conferring an unfettered discretion on the court. In my view, it means that the court has power to order or not to order the applicant to issue a writ of summons. It does not mean that in all cases, the court should order the issue of a writ. It is this transformation of the word �may� into a mandatory command which has resulted in unnecessary litigation in the past.�

__paragraph__
The decisions in both the Nimoh case and In re Arthur, I am happy to say, are decisions of courts of co-equal jurisdiction. As a result, \[p.814\] I am free to follow the one I favour. And I choose the view of the law as expressed by Archer J.A.

__paragraph__
Counsel conceded that the first caveator had no interest in the property of the deceased devised under the will, but he maintained that as the caveatrix claimed one of several properties devised by the will to be her ancestral property, she has established a sufficient interest in the estate, and the court is bound to order that the plaintiff do issue a writ of summons against the caveatrix on the authority of the decision in the Nimoh case. In the first place if the property she claims did not belong to the testator, then the devise in the will does not confer any interest in respect of that property on the beneficiary. Her legal interest in that property is therefore not affected by the grant of letters to the applicant. Secondly, since her claim is in respect of one small property out of several others devised to the applicant, she cannot claim to have the better right to the grant of letters of administration. Thirdly, since she says that the legal title to the property she claims rests in her, the only issue: �the determination of who is entitled to a grant of letters,� does not arise between her and the applicant. The issue which arises between her and the applicant is who is entitled to the legal title to the property she claims. As this issue cannot be determined in an action for letters of administration, I order that the caveats filed by both caveator and caveatrix be removed and that letters of administration with will annexed be issued to the applicant. I award costs of �200 in favour of the applicant against both caveators.

HEADNOTES

__paragraph__
The plaintiff was the customary successor and the defendant, a widow of the late JA who died intestate on 25 November 1971 and was possessed of a block of six flats in Takoradi. The defendant after the death of her husband continued to reside in one of the flats in which she, her husband and the children had lived immediately before his death. She also collected rents in respect of two other flats in the building and used the accrued rents to maintain herself and the children. On 13 March 1973 the plaintiff was alone granted letters of administration to administer the estate of the late JA. Subsequently, the plaintiff brought the instant action for an order that: (a) the defendant should return all the keys to the flats and (b) an account in respect of all the rents so far collected by the defendant in respect of the flats. Whilst the instant action was pending, the defendant applied for and was granted letters of administration jointly with the plaintiff under section 77 of the Administration of Estates Act, 1961 (Act 63). At the hearing, counsel for the defendant argued that as a co-administrator the plaintiff could not maintain the action against the defendant in her new capacity as a co-administratrix. But counsel for the plaintiff submitted that at the time the writ was issued against the defendant, she was not an administratrix and that during the period she collected rents she was an executor de son tort and could be sued for any amount in her hands.

__paragraph__
Held, dismissing the action:

__paragraph__
(1) the defendant as widow of the intestate at customary law had a beneficial life interest in her husband's estate. It was for that reason that the court granted her power to administer the estate jointly with the plaintiff under section 77 of the Administration of Estates Act, 1961 (Act 63), to enable her to protect the interest of her children who were then minors. The subsequent grant of letters of administration to the defendant perfected her title and related back to the death of her husband since her acts were done in the interest and for the benefit of the estate. The defendant was therefore not liable to account to the plaintiff. Ingall v. Moran \[1944\] K.B. 160 and Chetty v. Chetty \[1916\] 1 A.C. 603, P.C. cited.

__paragraph__
(2) The possessory life interest of a widow and her children was a right which was prior to any enjoyed by the customary successor or the deceased's family. The right to occupy the flat as a whole should be respected by the successor and the deceased's family. Abebreseh v. Kaah \[1976\] 2 G.L.R. 46 cited.

__paragraph__
(3) The appointment of the plaintiff as successor to the estate made him a representative of his family and a trustee and caretaker of the marriage. Under customary law the death of either spouse or both did not determine the union of the two families established by the marriage. The duty of the husband to provide accommodation and maintenance for his wife and children devolved upon his family or successor. That responsibility could only determine upon the death of the wife or the determination of the marriage in a lawful manner. Where the successor failed or refused to maintain the children of the deceased and their mother assumed that responsibility, she was entitled to sue the successor to recover any amount so spent. Since the plaintiff, as successor to the estate, failed to educate and provide reasonable maintenance for the children and their mother had to discharge those responsibilities, she became at common law an agent of necessity and therefore entitled to be reimbursed out of the estate. In addition, a mother had a right to claim from her husband or his successor expenses she incurred in maintaining and providing medical treatment for herself and her children. Manu v. Kuma \[1963\] 1 G.L.R. 464 at p. 469, S.C. applied.

__paragraph__
Per curiam. The defendant is now an old woman and is deteriorating in health. There is no question that she could re-marry and it appears she has no intention of taking a formal divorce from her husband's family. It would, therefore, be unfair and against good conscience in such circumstances for the successor or the husband's family to divorce her formally and give her a send off.

JUDGMENT OF SARKODEE J.

__paragraph__
The plaintiff is the customary successor and the defendant, one of two widows of the late John Arthur who died intestate on 25 November 1971, possessed of a block of six flats, House No. 120A, West Block, Takoradi, which was his self-acquired property. After the death of her husband the defendant continued to reside and still resides in one of the flats in which she, her husband and children lived immediately before his death. Also she collected rents from tenants who occupied other flats in the building. On 13 March 1973 the plaintiff alone was granted letters of administration to the estate of the deceased. Armed with this and aided by other members of the deceased's family, he demanded all keys to the flats including the one occupied by the defendant. He also asked her to account for the rents she had collected. The defendant surrendered the keys to all the flats except the one she occupied but refused to render accounts. The plaintiff was not satisfied and in effect was determined to throw the defendant and her children out of the flat in which she and her husband had lived for many years. In April 1973 the plaintiff instituted this action claiming:

__paragraph__
"(a) an order for the return of all keys to House No. 120A, West Block, Takoradi, to the plaintiff which said keys are with the defendant and which the defendant has refused to hand over despite repeated demands; and

__paragraph__
(b) an order for accounts in respect of all moneys belonging to the estate which have come to the defendant since the death of late John Arthur and payment of same to the plaintiff who is the successor and administrator of the estate of the late John Arthur."

__paragraph__
Whilst this suit was pending, the defendant, in view of the harassment she and her children were suffering from the hands of the plaintiff and her husband's family, and in particular fearing that the children who were then minors would not be maintained by her husband's successor, applied for and was granted letters of administration jointly with the plaintiff. Accordingly, she continued to collect rents out of which she maintained herself and her children. That was the situation until the court appointed a receiver and manager to the estate of John Arthur in July 1974.

__paragraph__
\[p.760\]

__paragraph__
The defendant says that the keys she holds are those to her flat. She explained that it was when the plaintiff refused to pay the school fees of her children and the out-goings such as electricity and water bills and rates in respect of the house that she in her capacity as one of the administrators acted and carried out those important duties. She says further that since November 1976 her children by the deceased have not been provided with maintenance. She, therefore, in her counterclaim asked the plaintiff as an administrator of her husband's estate to render accounts and for an order that the plaintiff out of the estate provides reasonable maintenance for the children.

__paragraph__
When the plaintiff applied to the court for the grant of letters of administration, the defendant entered a caveat and subsequently made serious allegations set out in the ruling of Charles Crabbe J. (as he then was) delivered on 10 April 1974. As the parties could not reach agreement the court ordered the applicant to take out summons within two weeks. When that was done pleadings were ordered and issues agreed upon and the case was set down for trial. After various adjournments, the parties announced a settlement the terms of which were:

__paragraph__
"(1) That letters of administration be granted to the plaintiff herein called Isaac Augustus Hayford.

__paragraph__
(2) That the defendant shall be granted �50 a month from the estate for her maintenance.

__paragraph__
(3) That the defendant and her three children by the deceased shall be granted a flat consisting of one half of a floor in House No. 120A, West Block, Takoradi, for her apartment.

__paragraph__
(4) That the plaintiff shall be responsible for the payment of school fees and maintenance of the deceased's three children with the defendant.

__paragraph__
(5) That rates and taxes and out-goings on House No. 120A, West Block, Takoradi, shall be borne by the estate."

__paragraph__
Upon these terms the court made the order for the issue of letters of administration which was done on 13 March 1973. Despite this settlement, the plaintiff, one month later, sealed a writ to commence the present action demanding keys including those for the defendant's flat. On 9 July 1973 when the matter came up for hearing counsel for the plaintiff suggested an amicable settlement. The court then ordered certain investigations to be conducted which revealed that the defendant would not be occupying a complete flat with her children if she surrendered keys to the bedroom, the sitting hall and the kitchen. It was after this report that the parties \[p.761\] appeared before Charles Crabbe J. who after referring to section 77 of the Administration of Estates Act, 1961 (Act 63), the defendant was appointed administratrix in addition to the plaintiff.

__paragraph__
Mr. Sekyi-Hughes, learned counsel for the defendant submitted that in as much as the parties are co-administrators the action against the defendant is not maintenable. As a general rule if there are several executors and administrators, they have a joint and entire interest in the estate of the testator or intestate which cannot be divided. Accordingly, they cannot maintain an action at law to protect the deceased's property against one another the reason being that a person cannot sue himself either alone or jointly with, others: see Ellis v. Kerr \[1910\] 1 Ch. 529. Mr. Hayfron-Benjamin on his part for the plaintiff argued that at the time the writ was issued the defendant was not administratrix and therefore the defendant when she collected rents from 1971 to May 1973 was in law an executor de son tort and could therefore be sued for any amount in her hand.

__paragraph__
It is not disputed that the property of an intestate does not, vest in the intestate's administrator until letters of administration have been granted to him. An executor de son tort is liable to be sued by the rightful representative. Also the defendant as a widow of the intestate, has at customary law a beneficial life interest in her husband's estate. In this regard, she has a right to protect the estate. There are cases where letters of administration in similar circumstances have been held to relate back to the death of the intestate so as to give validity to acts done before the letters of administration were granted, provided these acts were done in the interest and for the benefit of the deceased's estate: see Ingall v. Moran \[1944\] K.B. 160, C.A. In such cases the subsequent grant perfected the defendant's title and related back to the death of the deceased: see Chetty v. Chetty \[1916\] 1 A.C. 603, P.C. It was however held in Ingall v. Moran (supra) that the doctrine of relation back could be applied to representation which was incompetent when the writ was issued. The defendant would not have obtained the grant of letters of administration but for her interest in her husband's children. The court granted her power to administer the estate jointly with the plaintiff in accordance with section 77 of Act 63 to enable her protect the interests of her children who were then minors. Her duty was to see that the interest of those young ones was not trampled upon by their father's successor. I hold therefore that the defendant is not liable to account to the plaintiff. Even if I were to hold that the action was maintenable whatever the defendant did was in the interest of her late husband's \[p.762\] estate. The subsequent grant perfected the defendant's title and related back to the death of the deceased.

__paragraph__
The plaintiff claims from the defendant all the keys to House No. 120A, West Block, Takoradi. From his own evidence it seems the plaintiff was able to collect all the keys except those to the garage attached to the defendant's flat and the key to what has been described as the stranger's room. The plaintiff accepted as a condition to the defendant withdrawing the caveat that she and her children should continue to live in the flat. The garage and the stranger's room form part of the flat and were used as part of the whole flat and enjoyed with other amenities in the flat during the lifetime of the deceased. That apart, Charles Crabbe J. (as he then was) caused an inspection of the flat to be made and it became clear that it would be difficult for the defendant and her children to occupy only half of the flat. The defendant, her husband and her children lived in that flat for many years. The possessory life interest of the widow and her children is a right which is prior to any enjoyed by the customary successor or the widower's family: see Abebreseh v. Kaah \[1976\] 2 G.L.R. 46 at p. 61. It would be unreasonable to compel the defendant to surrender the keys. The right to occupy the flat as a whole should be respected by the successor and the deceased's family. She and her children should not surrender the keys to the flat. Rather they should occupy the whole flat as she and her husband enjoyed during his lifetime.

__paragraph__
The plaintiff by his appointment as customary successor became a representative of his family and a trustee or caretaker of the marriage. Under customary law, the death of either spouse or both does not determine the union of two families established by the marriage. Thus the husband's duty to provide accommodation and maintenance for his wife and children devolves upon his family or successor, a responsibility which can only determine upon the death of the wife or upon the determination of the marriage in a lawful manner: see Ollennu, The Law of Testate and Intestate Succession in Ghana chapter, 29. Where the successor fails or refuses to maintain the children of the deceased and their mother assumes that responsibility, she is entitled to sue the successor to recover any amount so spent. It was held in Manu v. Kuma \[1963\] 1 G.L.R. 464 at p. 469, S.C. that:

__paragraph__
"A mother is, in the absence of the father or the father's successor, the natural guardian of her infant child, and is entitled to sue on their behalf for their maintenance or for any other relief. Therefore the defendant, successor to the father, having neglected the children proper the person to sue is the mother \[p.763\] the plaintiff . . .; the plaintiff is therefore an agent of necessity of the defendant and is entitled at common law to be reimbursed as to the amount she was obliged to expend on her children."

__paragraph__
The plaintiff as successor to the estate of John Arthur failed to educate and provide reasonable maintenance for his children. It therefore became the burden of their mother to discharge those responsibilities. As an agent of necessity she is entitled at common law to be reimbursed out of her husband's estate the amount she spent on the children. Apart from the common law, a mother has a right to claim from her husband or his successor expenses she may incur for maintaining and providing medical treatment for herself and her children. The defendant has been responsible for the maintenance of herself and her children since the death of her husband in 1971 and has been paying the children's school fees, the plaintiff having neglected to perform those duties. The plaintiff does not deny this but says that he failed to look after the children because the children of the defendant were hostile to him. But the undisputed fact is that the defendant and her children could not trust the plaintiff. It appears the very first time after the death of John Arthur when the plaintiff entered house No. 120A, West Block, Takoradi, that he went there solely to demand from the defendant keys for the flat and indeed threatened to eject the widow and her children out of the flat. It was the plaintiff's persistent demand for the keys and the widow and her children's determination to protect their rights as owners of the life interest in the deceased's self-acquired property that started the quarrels between him and the defendant and her children. The plaintiff cannot be heard to say he refused to maintain the children because of their attitude. They had to act in defence of their rights.

__paragraph__
The defendant's eldest child has since been married but the other two, though over 21 years in each case, are undergoing full time education and ought therefore to be maintained out of their father's estate. The defendant estimates that the children spent about fifteen cedis a day. That amount was given before the present day rate of inflation. I would therefore raise that amount to twenty cedis a day. I order that this sum should be paid out of the estate to the defendant and her children for as long as she remains a widow and the children up to the age of 25 years each or cease full time education whichever is earlier. The successor shall pay the school fees of the children.

__paragraph__
The defendant started to collect rents for the estate as soon as her husband died until the court appointed a receiver and manager. She admitted that she spent some moneys out of the rents for the children.

__paragraph__
\[p.764\]

__paragraph__
I do not therefore think she is entitled to be reimbursed for expenses she incurred.

__paragraph__
The defendant is now an old woman and is deteriorating in health. There is no question that she could re-marry and it appears she has no intention of taking a formal divorce from her husband's family. It would, therefore, be unfair and against good conscience in such circumstances for the successor or the husband's family to divorce her formally and give her a send off. The defendant lived with the deceased husband for many years when he was a regional commissioner and no doubt ably played the part of a regional commissioner's wife. It would be inequitable to reduce the size of the flat as she enjoyed together with her family and make her share it with another family. That in my view would amount to a lowering of her standard of living. I do not therefore think that she would be asking for too much, and I accordingly direct that the life interest of the widow and her children should cover the entire flat as occupied by her and her husband during his lifetime including the garage, sitting hall, stranger's room and the kitchen together with its amenities.
