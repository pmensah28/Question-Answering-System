ADJEI,J.A:

__paragraph__
This is an appeal against the judgment of the High Court Nkawkaw dated 28th February, 2013. The Plaintiffs/Respondents on their writ of summons claimed for seven reliefs including cost. They are as follows:

__paragraph__
“a. Declaration that the termination of the Plaintiffs’ appointment with the Defendant hospital by medical superintendent was unfair and unlawful.

__paragraph__
b. an order compelling the Defendant to pay compensation to each and every Plaintiff as a result of unfair termination of employment.

__paragraph__
c. General damages for malicious prosecution.

__paragraph__
d. General damages for defamation

__paragraph__
e. Declaration that the deduction of monthly salaries of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Plaintiffs which were paid into the Defendant’s accounts were unlawful.

__paragraph__
f. An order disgorge the unjust profit/interest earned on the deductions made on the half salaries of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Plaintiffs which were lodges in the Defendants’ account for over three years and same refunded to the affected Plaintiffs compelling the Defendant to herein.

__paragraph__
g. An order for the payment of the salary arrears to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th and 8th Plaintiffs which the Defendant has refused to pay despite several demands.

__paragraph__
h. costs”.

__paragraph__
The Plaintiffs abandoned reliefs (c) and (d) on the writ. The trial High Court Judge dismissed all the other reliefs and granted reliefs (b), (e), (f) and (g).

__paragraph__
The Defendant appealed against the judgment of the trial High Court to this Court on 26th April, 2013. The two grounds of appeal filed by the Defendant are as follows:

__paragraph__
“1. The judgment is against the weight of evidence on record.

__paragraph__
2\. That the learned trial Judge was wrong when she held – “once the defendant assign a reason “unsatisfactory work performance” when the defendant assumed the burden of proving same on balance of probabilities. This, the defendant woefully failed to do” and that error occasioned a grave miscarriage of justice.”

__paragraph__
I shall discuss the two grounds of appeal together as both of them require the Court to evaluate the entire evidence on record and come to the conclusion the trial Judge did not properly discuss either the facts or the law or both, and if the errors are corrected, the judgment should be overturned. Where there are evidence that the facts were not properly discussed and if they are properly discussed and evaluated the errors to be corrected, may overturn the judgment, the appeal should succeed.

__paragraph__
On the other hand, where the errors are corrected and would not disturb the judgment, the appeal should fail. Where a court is setting aside a judgment, on the premise that the judgment is against the evidence on record, the court must satisfy itself that the mistakes to be corrected arising from the improper evaluation of the facts should be a genuine one and not fanciful errors.

__paragraph__
In the case in point the Appellant’s concern is that the trial Judge held that an employer who terminates the employee’s employment is not required to assign reason but where he assigns reasons he should be able to justify it. The Defendant disagrees with the above statement made by the trial court which influenced its decision and the correct position of the law should be restated.

__paragraph__
The trial Judge made the following reliefs after having discussed the evidence on record;

__paragraph__
“In conclusion, this court makes the following orders:

__paragraph__
1.The Defendant should pay each Plaintiff, except the eight, fifteen months salary as compensation or damages for wrongful termination or dismissal.

__paragraph__
2.The Defendant is also to pay to each Plaintiff with the exception of the eight Plaintiffs, all entitlements if any under the contract of employment which were due or earned by the Plaintiffs but which remain unpaid by the Defendant.”

__paragraph__
A look at the relief (1) granted by the trial court reveals that the trial Judge could not draw a distinction between wrongful termination and dismissal. The fifteen months salary as compensation was awarded by her for “wrongful termination or dismissal.”

__paragraph__
There are difference among dismissal, wrongful termination and unfair termination and if the trial Judge should have used the terminologies correctly, she would have settled on what the compensation of fifteen months was meant for.

__paragraph__
Dismissal is where an employee’s appointment has been truncated based on his behavior. Where the employee is dismissed contrary to the breach of the rule of natural justice or the collective agreement or a statute, he is said to have been unlawfully dismissed. A dismissal is an embarrassment as the employee loses most of his benefit. In the case of Aboagye vrs. Ghana Commercial Bank Ltd, \[2001-2002\] SCGLR 798where the employee was dismissed without a hearing it was held to constitute a wrongful dismissal. In other words, where disciplinary procedure rules provide that an employee should be heard irrespective of the offence, or the acts he commits, he should be heard. Employers are to ensure that disciplinary procedure rules are complied with to the letter.

__paragraph__
A hearing in dismissal cases does not necessarily require the presence of the employee except where the disciplinary procedure rules provide that the employee should be physically present as in the case of Aboagye vrs. Ghana Commercial Bank (supra). In the case of Aryee vrs. State Construction Corporation \[1984-86\] 1 GLR 424, it was held that writing a letter to the employee to inform him about his misconduct or impropriety and asking him to respond in writing constituted a hearing.

__paragraph__
In the case of dismissal, where the employee is not given a hearing or where he was dismissed contrary to the disciplinary procedure rules in that establishment, the dismissal would be held to be unlawful. For example, where a person is said to have stolen from his work place, he must be heard on the allegation of the impropriety before he could be dismissed. In a case where the administrative procedure rules requires that a person who absents himself from work for a week without an excuse should be suspended, an employee who absents himself from work for a week without excuse cannot be dismissed else it would flout the administrative procedure rules and the dismissal would amount to unlawful dismissal.

__paragraph__
Termination on the other hand is not an embarrassment. The employee who is being terminated goes with all his benefits. An employer may terminate the employment of an employee without any reason provided the notice to be given or the salary in lieu of notice is in accordance with the Collective Agreement or the contract regulating their relationship. The employee too may terminate his employment with his employer without assigning any reason provided the notice given or the salary in lieu of notice paid is in accordance with the contract regulating their employment.

__paragraph__
In the case of Bannerman-Menson vrs. Ghana Employers Association \[1996-97\] SCGLR 417 the Supreme Court held that either the employer or the employee may terminate his employment with his employer without assigning any reason and the employer could do the same thing. A termination is said to be unlawful where the parties who terminates the employment fails to give the required notice or salary in lieu of notice. In such a case, damages are awarded to compensate the injured party.

__paragraph__
Unfair termination is where a party assigns a reason for the termination (even though he is not bound to give) and if he gives and is proved to be false, damages may be awarded. The burden of proof would be on the person who offered the reason and has proved to be false. Under the Labour Act, Section 63 has set out the grounds that may constitute unfair termination:

__paragraph__
“63.1. The employment of a worker shall not be unfairly terminated by the worker’s employer.

__paragraph__
2\. A worker’s employments is terminated unfairly if the only reason for the termination is :

__paragraph__
a. that the worker has joined, intends to join or has ceased to be a member of a trade union or intends to take part in the activities of a trade union.

__paragraph__
b. that the worker seeks office as, or is acting or has acted in the capacity of, a workers’ representative;

__paragraph__
c. that the worker has filed a complaint or participated in proceedings against the employer involving alleged violation of this Act or any other enactment.

__paragraph__
d. the worker’s gender, race, colour, ethnicity, origin, religion, creed, social, political or economic status;

__paragraph__
e. in the case of a woman worker, due to the pregnancy of the worker or the absence of the worker from work during maternity leave;

__paragraph__
f. in the case of a worker with a disability; due to the worker’s disability.

__paragraph__
g. that the worker is temporarily ill or injured and this is certified by a recognized medical practitioner;

__paragraph__
h. that the worker does not possess the current level of qualification required in relation to the work for which the worker was employed which is different from the level of qualification required at the commencement of the employment; or

__paragraph__
i. that the worker refused or indicated an intention to refuse to do a work normally done by a worker who at the time was taking part in a lawful strike unless the work is necessary to prevent actual danger to life, personal safety or health or the maintenance of plant and equipment.

__paragraph__
(3) Without limiting the provisions of subsection (2), a worker’s employment is deemed to be unfairly terminated if with or without notice to the employer, the worker terminates the contract of employment

__paragraph__
a. because of ill-treatment of the worker by the employer, having regard to the circumstances of the case, or

__paragraph__
b. because the employer has failed to take action on repeated complaints of sexual harassment of the worker at the workplace.

__paragraph__
(4) A termination may be unfair if the employer fails to prove that

__paragraph__
a. the reason for the termination is fair, or

__paragraph__
b .the termination was made in accordance with a fair procedure or this Act

__paragraph__
64\. Remedies for Unfair termination

__paragraph__
(1) A worker who claims that the employment of the worker has been unfairly terminated by the worker’s employer may present a complaint to the Commission.

__paragraph__
(2) If on investigation of the complaint the Commission finds that the termination of the employment is unfair, it may

__paragraph__
a. order the employer to re-instate the worker from the date of the termination of employment.

__paragraph__
b. order the employer to re-employ the worker, in the work for which the worker was employed before the termination or in any other reasonably suitable work on the same terms and conditions enjoyed by the worker before the termination; or

__paragraph__
c. order the employer to pay compensation to the worker”.

__paragraph__
From the above, one could have thought that section 63 was a statute applicable to all institutions but the Supreme Court in the Bani vrs. Maersk Ghana Ltd. \[2011\] 2 SCGLR 796, has categorically stated that it is only applicable to Labour Commission. This Court therefore lacks jurisdiction to determine whether the termination was fair or unfair

__paragraph__
Unfair termination is unknown to common law as an employee or employer complies with a contract or law regulating the employment but the reason he assigns is found to be false. In the case of Bani vrs. Maersk Ghana Ltd.(supra) the Supreme Court held:

__paragraph__
“That unfair termination is not a common law principle and even though it was provided by the Labour Act, 2003 (Act 651) it was provided by the Labour Act, 2003 (Act 651) it was not meant to be applied by the Courts at the suit of a party to an employment contract”.

__paragraph__
The Plaintiffs in this appeal neither sued for unlawful dismissal nor unlawful termination and there is no scintilla of evidence to support any of the two grounds. In the case of Dam vs. J.K. Addo Brothers \[1962) 2 GLR 200, the Supreme Court held that a court must not substitute a case proprio motu nor accept a case which is contrary to what he puts forward as his case. The grounds of the appeal succeed as there is no evidence on record to support unlawful dismissal or unlawful termination as concluded by the Judge.

__paragraph__
The case of unfair termination should have been discussed by the trial Court as that was the case put forward by the Plaintiffs but this Court is bound by the ratio in the case of Bani vs. Maersk Ghana Limited \[2011\] (supra) where the Supreme Court unanimously held that the Courts do not have jurisdiction to entertain matters on unfair termination and the proper authority to handle such cases is the Labour Commission. Even though the Supreme Court quoted its earlier decision of Ashun vs. Accra Brewery Ltd. \[2009\] SCGLR 81, which purported to cloth the Courts with jurisdiction to entertain matters of unfair termination, it impliedly departed from it in the case ofBani vs. Maersk Ghana Ltd. (supra) and we are bound by it.

__paragraph__
The appeal succeeds and the judgment of the High Court Nkawkaw on 28th February, 2013 is hereby set aside.

JUSTICE OF APPEAL

__paragraph__
AVRIL LOVELACE-JOHNSON (JA.)

__paragraph__
The present appeal is against the judgment of the High Court delivered on 28th February 2013. By that judgment the Court had ordered the Defendant/Appellant to pay to each Plaintiff (except the 8th plaintiff) fifteen (15) months salary as compensation or damages for wrongful termination or dismissal all entitlements due them under their contract of employments which remained unpaid and costs of GH₵ 2,000.00.

__paragraph__
Being dissatisfied with the said judgment the Defendants/Appellants appeal to this Court for its reversal on the following grounds:

__paragraph__
“(i) That the judgment is against the weight of evidence.

__paragraph__
(ii)That the learned trial judge was wrong when she held that –once the defendants assign a reason “unsatisfactory work performance” then the defendant assumed the burden of proving same on balance of probabilities. This is the defendant woefully fails to do, “and that error occasioned a grave miscarriage of justice” (sic).

__paragraph__
(iii)That the learned trial judge erred in law by relying on a burden of proof other than the standard required in civil cases and that resulted in a miscarriage of justice.

__paragraph__
(iv)That the meaning assigned to the phrase “unsatisfactory performance” by the learned trial judge is over exaggerated beyond their dictionary meaning and wrongfully applied that meaning in her judgment that has occasioned a miscarriage of justice (sic).

__paragraph__
(v)That the respondent completely failed to proved their claimed that the termination of their appointments were unfair and unlawful as the court rightly found (sic)”.

__paragraph__
The Plaintiffs had by the writ of summons sought the following reliefs:

__paragraph__
“(a) Declaration that the termination of the Plaintiffs’ appointments with the Defendant hospital by medical superintendent was unfair and unlawful.

__paragraph__
b)An order compelling the defendant to pay compensation to each and every Plaintiff as a result of unfair termination of employment.

__paragraph__
c)General damages for malicious prosecution.

__paragraph__
d)General damages for defamation.

__paragraph__
e)Declaration that the deduction of monthly salaries of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Plaintiffs which were paid into the Defendant’s account was unlawful.

__paragraph__
f)An order to disgorge the unjust profit/interest earned on the deductions made on the half salaries of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Plaintiffs which were lodged in the Defendant’s account for over three years and same refunded to the affected Plaintiffs compelling the Defendant to herein.

__paragraph__
g)An order for the payment of the salary arrears to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th and 8th Plaintiffs which the Defendant has refused to pay despite several demands.

__paragraph__
h)Costs”.

__paragraph__
The parties will be referred to by designations used in the High Court.

__paragraph__
The case of the Plaintiffs in the High Court as per evidence given on their behalf by two of their members was that after being accused by a committee set up by the Defendants for stealing, they were arraigned before the Circuit Court on a charges of stealing. They were acquitted and discharged after trial. Prior to this, they were interdicted and put on half of their salaries. Their position was that their prosecution had been initiated by the Defendants. They pointed out that having worked satisfactorily for the Defendants, as evidenced by their various promotions and awards, the termination of their appointment was unfair and unlawful.

__paragraph__
The position of the Defendants on the other hand was that as a result of the Plaintiff tampering with the computer system at the hospital the latter lost money. The plaintiffs were interdicted and after an audit investigation, the matter was referred to the police who after their own investigation charged them with the offence of stealing. Upon their acquittal, the plaintiffs’ appointments were terminated and all entitlements due them paid to them. Their termination was on the grounds that their services were unsatisfactory.

__paragraph__
Now to the grounds of appeal

__paragraph__
I wish to first deal with concerns raised by counsel for Plaintiffs, regarding grounds III and IV of the grounds of appeal earlier listed.

__paragraph__
In respect of grounds III, counsel contends that it sins against Rule 8(4) of The Court of Appeal Rules 1997 CI 19. By this an appellant who alleges misdirection or error in law is required to state clearly the particulars of such misdirection or error.

__paragraph__
In the case of ground IV, counsel again contends that it sins against Rule 8(6) because it is vague.

__paragraph__
I have looked at both grounds and I am satisfied that ground III does provide sufficient particulars of the alleged error which is that the learned trial Judge used a burden of proof other than that required in a civil case. Ground IV, while being verbose can certainly not be said to be vague.

__paragraph__
No submissions were made on the first two grounds of appeal. They are deemed to have been abandoned.

__paragraph__
Grounds iii, iv & v can conveniently be taken together. The fifth ground of appeal is that the plaintiffs failed to prove that their termination were unfair and unlawful. On this ground Counsel for the Defendants submits that immediately the Court determined that the defendants terminated the employment of the plaintiff in accordance with the terms of their contract of employment and so found the termination lawful, the court should have dismissed the case of the plaintiffs.

__paragraph__
The position of the counsel for the Plaintiffs appears to be that the finding of the court that the termination was lawful did not necessarily mean it was fair. Counsel cites Sections 62 and 63 (4) of the Labour Act, 2003, Act 251 and states that the plaintiffs termination of employment was most unfair. He also cites the case of Kobi and others vs. Ghana Manganese Co. Ltd. (2007-2008) SCGLR at 794.

__paragraph__
Is the complaint of Counsel for the Defendant borne out by the record and the law?

__paragraph__
Exhibits A1 – A7 are the termination letters of the Plaintiffs. In each of them no reason was given for the termination. Each letter also stated that the worker was entitled to one month’s salary in lieu of notice. Exhibit D, the collective agreement governing the working relationship between the parties states in Article 28 that each party to the agreement is to give the other one month’s notice or one month’s payment in lieu of such notice excepting summary dismissal.

__paragraph__
It is obvious then that there is no need to give a reason for termination under this Article. The letter of termination given to the plaintiffs clearly satisfied the conditions stated therein. In the said letters the only reasons given were that management could not work with the plaintiffs. On the face of it then, the termination of the plaintiff was in accordance with the terms of Exhibit D. To the trial Court, this made the said termination lawful.

__paragraph__
If the plaintiffs had not issued the present writ, that would have been the end of the matter but the present writ was issued. The trial Court took the position that once the Defendants gave a reason other than a right to terminate in their statement of defence they became duty bound to prove this defence. The defence was that the plaintiffs’ work performance was unsatisfactory and this according to the court they failed to prove on the balance of probabilities.

__paragraph__
The question to be answered at this stage is whether it was proper for the trial court to expect the defendants to discharge any burden of proof after having found that the termination was lawful on the face of it because it was done in accordance with Exhibit D, the CBA.

__paragraph__
In the Supreme Court case of Kobi Vs. Ghana Manganese Co. Ltd. 2007-2008 2 SCGLR 771 the Supreme Court in deciding an appeal on a claim for damages for wrongful termination of appointment stated the traditional rule that an employer was at liberty in dispensing with the services of an employee to give or refuse to give reasons once its done in accordance with the contract of service (Aryee vs. State Construction Corporation (1984-86) 1 GLR 424). The Court per Ansah JSC further stated that

__paragraph__
“in seeking to exercise the right to give or not to give reasons, fairness must be the watch word. Every allegation of misconduct ought to be proved” .

__paragraph__
While this case was not one for declaration by the plaintiffs that their termination was unfair or damages for same, the court referred to what constituted unfair termination of employment under the Labour Act and stated that the fact that all due entitlements have been paid does not necessarily mean a termination is fair even when the employer (as in the present case) has power to terminate the employment in accordance with the CBA.

__paragraph__
The answer to the question earlier posed then is that, yes, having alleged “wrong doing” on the part of the Plaintiffs it was proper for the court to require the Defendants to prove this allegation inspite of the finding that the termination had been ‘lawfully’ done in accordance with Exhibit D, the CBA

__paragraph__
On this issue the learned Trial Judge delivered herself as follows at page 42 of the record of appeal:

__paragraph__
“once the defendant made the assertion that it terminated the plaintiff’s appointment because of unsatisfactory conduct or performance then the onus was on the defendant to prove the unsatisfactory conduct of the plaintiff. However the defendant failed to discharge this burden. It could not even convince the trial criminal court that the plaintiff had indeed stolen its money and in this court too, the defendant could not tell what precisely the plaintiffs did that enabled them to manipulate its computer system to steal money belonging to the defendant. The defendant could also could also not tell what amount each individual plaintiff stole. It could not even tender in evidence copies of the alleged queries it issued to the plaintiffs for their unsatisfactory conduct. This court thus cannot make a finding of fact that the plaintiffs appointments were terminated because of their unsatisfactory performance or conduct”.

__paragraph__
The summary of the evidence of the Defendants’ Representative earlier given in this judgment indeed confirms the learned trial Judge’s position. From counsel for Defendants submissions, he appears to be saying that once it was established that the loss of GH₵ 44,000 took place at a place where the plaintiffs exclusively worked and that they were the only ones who operated the computers then the Defendants had been able to successfully prove that the work of the plaintiffs was unsatisfactory.

__paragraph__
All this by itself without more cannot be said to be sufficient proof on the balance of probabilities that the plaintiffs work was unsatisfactory. The fact that the trial court referred to the defendants failure to prove the plaintiffs guilt in the criminal court does not mean she applied the standard of proof in criminal cases to the present case as alleged in the third ground of appeal.

__paragraph__
Without doubt they failed to discharge the burden of proof required in civil cases.

__paragraph__
This failure to discharge the evidential burden imposed on them by law is not a result of the trial court giving an exaggerated meaning to the phrase “unsatisfactory performance” as claimed in the fourth ground of appeal. What was required was not a dictionary meaning of the phrase in question as counsel for Defendants seems to imply but proof of their assertion. No miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the court’s finding that the evidence led was not sufficient proof of this allegation since this conclusion is borne out by the evidence led.

__paragraph__
In its judgment the court made reference to section 62 of the Labour Act of 2003, Act 651. It is sufficient only to state that the case of Bani vs. Maersk Ghana Ltd. 2011 2 SCGLR is authority for the proposition that the provisions of sections 62 & 63 of the said Act are directed at the Labour Commission and not the Courts and that the recourse of a person who complains of unfair termination is not a claim for damages before the courts but a complaint before the Labour Commission.

__paragraph__
On the basis of this my esteemed brother and sister take the position that the trial Court “lacks jurisdiction to determine whether the termination was fair or unfair”. It is clear from page 150 of the Record of Appeal that the Judge was in no doubt that she had no jurisdiction to make such a determination. The present action was not decided under the provisions of Act 651 despite the Judge’s reference to its provisions.

__paragraph__
Her conclusion that the termination of the appointments of the plaintiffs was wrongful and unfair was because she took the position that the Defendants, having failed to prove the alleged unsatisfactory work performance and the plaintiffs having on the other hand led evidence of satisfactory work by tendering promotion letters, best worker award, etc. the balance of probabilities favoured the latter.

__paragraph__
What are the consequences of the finding that the balance of possibilities favour the plaintiffs? I am satisfied that this finding means that the evidence supports a case of wrongful termination. As already stated the plaintiffs had sought damages for unfair termination – (an award the trial court would not have had jurisdiction to make) what the court awarded was damages for wrongful termination or dismissal. See page 155 of the Record of Appeal.

__paragraph__
A reference has been made to the case of DAM VS. J.K. ADDO BROTHERS (1962) 2 GLR 2000where the Supreme Court held that a court must not substitute a case or accept a case which is contrary to what a party has put forward.

__paragraph__
I am satisfied from the evidence that the case put forward by the plaintiffs is one of wrongful termination of appointment. That being so are the plaintiffs to be denied recompense because they make a claim for compensation for unfair termination of employment rather than seeking to be compensated for wrongful termination?

__paragraph__
I think not. This is a Court of law as well as equity. It also exercises its jurisdiction “by way of rehearing”. The courts go to extreme lengths to do justice rather than insisting on form. In the light of the position taken by the Supreme Court in the case of Hana Assi (No.2) vs. Gihoc Refrigeration (2007-2008) SCGLR 16 that where a judicial relief is clearly established by the evidence led by a defendant, the proper and fair thing to do will be to grant him the said relief, I feel no hesitation in changing the damages awarded by the trial court for “wrongful termination or dismissal” to damages for wrongful termination.

__paragraph__
Admittedly that case dealt with the question of whether a defendant who had not filed a counterclaim deserved a judicial relief supported by her evidence.

__paragraph__
I see no reason why a plaintiff should not be entitled to the same consideration. Interestingly there is no appeal by the defendants against the damages awarded in this case.

__paragraph__
I am satisfied that the plaintiffs were entitled to the said damages.

__paragraph__
In conclusion, I find no merit in the three grounds of appeal canvassed by the Appellant to warrant the reversal of the decision of the High court. The appeal is dismissed in its entirety.
