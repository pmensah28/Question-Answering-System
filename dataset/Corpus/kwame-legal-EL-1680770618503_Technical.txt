A. M. DOMAKYAAREH (MRS), J.A.

__paragraph__
1\. The appellant in this case was charged with two criminal offences in the Kumasi High Court, namely:-

__paragraph__
i.Conspiracy to commit robbery contrary to Sections 23(1) and 149 of Act 29/60 as amended by Act 646 and

__paragraph__
ii.Robbery contrary to Section 149 of Act 29/60 as amended by Act 646 of 2003

__paragraph__
After the trial, he was convicted on both counts on 13th June 2007 and sentenced to 25 years Imprisonment with Hard Labour (IHL) on each of the two counts to run concurrently. The appellant filed the instant appeal pursuant to leave granted by this Court on 25th November 2014.

__paragraph__
2\. THE FACTS OF THE CASE:

__paragraph__
The facts of the case as found at pages 3 to 4 of the Record of Appeal disclose that the Complainant; (one Samuel Frimpong) is a trader who lives at Buokrom. On 8th April 2006 at about 9:20pm, a customer went to the complainant’s shop in order to buy mobile phone units. The customer gave his mobile phone to the complainant to load the units. In the process of loading the units, the appellant who was a pillion rider on a motor cycle arrived and demanded that the complainant should hand over the phone to him. The rider of the motor cycle is still at large. The appellant, who was armed with a pistol pointed it at the complainant and threatened to kill him if he did not comply with the order to hand over the phone.

__paragraph__
A Security Officer at Churchill Hotel which was close by saw what was happening and ordered the appellant and his accomplice to stop. The appellant pointed his pistol at the Security Officer. The security officer who was armed fired and a bullet hit the appellant in the eye. The appellant dropped his pistol and he and his accomplice managed to escape. Some of the bullets from the gun fired by the security officer hit other people who came to the scene and they were taken to the hospital for treatment. At the Hospital, the complainant and one of the injured saw the appellant and identified him. The appellant told the medical officer that he was hurt by an iron rod. An X-ray revealed that he was hit by a bullet. He then claimed that he was shot by his friend with whom he was quarrelling and named several people as witnesses. When the people were contacted they said they did not know the appellant. The appellant could not also lead the Police to arrest the person who allegedly attacked and shot him.

__paragraph__
3\. The appellant is fighting his conviction and sentence on three grounds, namely:-

__paragraph__
a.The Court erred when it convicted the accused on circumstantial evidence and this occasioned a substantial miscarriage of justice

__paragraph__
b.The trial judge erred when he failed to give reasons for the conviction and this rendered the whole trial a nullity.

__paragraph__
c.The sentence of twenty-five years I. H. L. is harsh and excessive in the light of the circumstances of the case.

__paragraph__
We proceed to consider the grounds of appeal seriatim in the light of the evidence available in the Record of Appeal.

__paragraph__
4\. GROUND (a) OF THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL:

__paragraph__
The Court erred when it convicted the accused on circumstantial evidence and this occasioned a substantial miscarriage of justice.

__paragraph__
Counsel for the appellant quoted the revised version of Section 23(1) of the Criminal and Other Offences Act 1960 (Act 29) as follows:-

__paragraph__
“If two or more persons agree to act together with a common purpose for or in committing or abetting a crime, whether with or without any previous concert or deliberation, each of them is guilty of conspiracy to commit or abet that crime as the case may be” (emphasis supplied by Counsel).

__paragraph__
He then proceeded to list four ingredients that the Prosecution ought to establish to secure a conviction for conspiracy as follows:-

__paragraph__
“1. That there must be two or more persons

__paragraph__
2\. That the persons must agree to act together

__paragraph__
3\. That they held a common purpose and;

__paragraph__
4\. That the common purpose must be either to commit or abet a crime”.

__paragraph__
Counsel for the appellant then argued that since there was no evidence whatsoever to establish in anyway either directly or otherwise that the accused did agree together with the one other (at large) to act together to commit the alleged robbery, the prosecution had failed to prove the ingredient of “previous agreement” hence the prosecution’s case ought to fail.

__paragraph__
5\. The wording in the above above quotation of “Section 23(1) of the Criminal and Other Offences Act, 1960 (Act 29)” has changed slightly in the current position of the law. The current wording of Section 23(1) of the Criminal Offences Act, 1960 (Act 29) provides as follows:-

__paragraph__
“23. Conspiracy

__paragraph__
(1)Where two or more persons agree or act together with a common purpose for or in committing or abetting a criminal offence, whether with or without a previous concert or deliberation, each of them commits a conspiracy to commit or abet the criminal offence”.

__paragraph__
Even going by the Section 23(1) version of Counsel for the appellant, he chose to severe the section and place emphasis on “agree together” and ignore or jettison “whether with or without any previous concert or deliberation” which also appears in his version. This is, to say the least, very disingenuous, as by so doing, Counsel was probably inadvertently dabbling in the English law on conspiracy which is different from the Ghana law on conspiracy. Case law and academic text books on the subject amply demonstrate the difference between English law on conspiracy and Ghana law on conspiracy.

__paragraph__
6\. In the case of COMMISSIONER OF POLICE VRS AFARI AND ADDO (1962)1 GLR 483, the appellants were charged with conspiracy to defraud by false pretences and duly convicted. The first appellant was also convicted on a second count of defrauding by false pretences, and the second appellant was convicted on a third count of aiding and abetting the first appellant. Both appealed against their convictions.

__paragraph__
In the Supreme Court it was argued among others that there was no evidence of an agreement between the appellants and that since the only evidence adduced was in respect of the substantive charge of fraud by false pretences, it was irregular to include in the charge a count of conspiracy. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal stating unequivocally that: -

__paragraph__
“In the opinion of the Court, the Ghana law of conspiracy is wider in scope and in content than the English law on the subject. It consists not only in the criminal agreement between two minds, but also in the acting together in furtherance of a common criminal offence.”

__paragraph__
P. K. Twumasi, in his Book “Criminal Law in Ghana” at page 106 thereof reiterates the position as follows:-

__paragraph__
“Our law is wider in the sense that while it is essential to prove a previous agreement in all cases of conspiracy in English law a person may be convicted in Ghana for conspiracy even though there is no proof of such previous agreement. To succeed in a charge of conspiracy the prosecution may prove either

__paragraph__
(1) That the accused agreed together with a common purpose for or in committing or abetting a crime

__paragraph__
Or

__paragraph__
(2)That the accused persons acted together with a common purpose for or in committing or abetting a crime”.

__paragraph__
7\. From the evidence in the Record of Appeal, the Prosecution proved overt acts by the appellant and his accomplice at large which showed that they acted together with a common purpose to commit the criminal offence of robbery by these incidents:-

__paragraph__
�The appellant was a pillion rider on a motor driven by his accomplice (page three (3) of the Record of Appeal

__paragraph__
�The complainant (PW1 Samuel Frimpong) and the Security Guard (PW2 Kwasi Boateng) at pages 9 and 10 of the Record of Appeal respectively stated that both the appellant and his accomplice ordered the complainant to hand over the phone to them and that they pointed rifles on the complainant and the customer who went to buy the phone units.

__paragraph__
These acts of the appellant and his accomplice are direct acts which satisfy the requirements of Ghana law and are in no way circumstantial as Counsel for the appellant would want this court to believe.

__paragraph__
8\. Under the first ground of appeal, Counsel for the appellant also canvassed very strenuously that the only evidence linking the accused to the offence was circumstantial evidence. There is however the direct evidence of eyewitnesses to the robbery who positively identified the accused. These are the complainant Samuel Frimpong (PW1) and Kwasi Boateng the Security Guard at the Churchill Hotel (PW2). PW1’s sister who was at the Komfo Anokye Hospital when the appellant was sent to that hospital called PW1 and informed him that one of the robbers had been brought to the hospital. The case of ADU BOAHENE VRS THE REPUBLIC \[1972\] GLR 70 comes in point. The complainant in this case, a petrol dealer, alleged that he was violently robbed at about 9 p.m. one evening while carrying money in a bag from his petrol filling station to his house. Not long after the robbery he took the police to the house of the appellant whom he identified as one of the three robbers. He alleged that he had known the appellant at his filling station for about two years and this was confirmed by one of his attendants at the station. The appellant denied the allegation against him and said that since he was not at the scene of the crime at all, the witnesses were mistaken. The only issue at the trial was whether the appellant was one of the robbers. The jury accepted the evidence of the prosecution and he was consequently convicted and sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment with hard labour. He appealed on the main ground that the sentence was excessive and also that there was insufficient evidence of his identity. In dismissing the appeal, the court held per holding (1) that “where the identity of an accused person is in issue, there can be no better proof of his identity than the evidence of a witness who swears to have seen the accused committing the offence charged.”

__paragraph__
9\. This direct evidence was not of concern to the appellant and his counsel. Their beef was that no medical report was tendered at the trial to indicate that the injury to the eye was from a gunshot and that no ballistic expert was called as a witness to testify that the injury to the eye of the appellant was shot from the gun of the Security Guard.

__paragraph__
Relying on circumstantial evidence is not new to the law. The only constraint is that for circumstantial evidence to succeed in the conviction of an accused person, it must point to one and only one conclusion. Among the bevy of authorities that espouse this position of the law is DEXTER JOHNSON V THE REPUBLIC (2011) SCGLR 601 AT 605 where at holding 1, the Supreme Court delivered itself thus: -

__paragraph__
“Circumstantial evidence was quite usual as it was rare to prove an offence by evidence of eyewitnesses; and inferences from facts proved might prove the guilt of the appellant. A presumption from circumstantial evidence should be drawn against the appellant only when that presumption would follow irresistibly from the circumstances proved in evidence; and in order to justify the inference of guilt the inculpatory facts must be incompatible with the innocence of the appellant and incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable hypothesis other than that of guilt.”

__paragraph__
10\. It is worthy of note that the appellant changed the story of the injury to his eye but eventually settled on gunshot injury when he was confronted with the medical finding backed by the X-ray report. At page 4 of the Record of Appeal the appellant told the medical officer that he was hurt by an iron rod. When this did not work, he told the doctor that he fought with a friend who shot him in the eye (See page 16 of the Record of Appeal) but he failed to go and identify that friend to the Police. Besides when the investigator (PW3) No. 33930 D/L Corporal Daniel Adodo testified in his examination-in-chief that PW2, who shot the appellant came to inform the Police that he shot the accused, he did not challenge this evidence. When PW2 also testified that he shot the accused, he did not challenge him. It is thus our considered opinion that these circumstances lead to the irresistible and inevitable conclusion that the eye injury was as a result of the gun shot fired by PW2 and for that reason any other witnesses, whether medical officer and or ballistic expert would have been surplusage. The accused himself ultimately admitted that the injury to his eye was from a gunshot.

__paragraph__
It is the quality and not the quantity of witnesses that determines whether the required standard of proof has been met. In this case the evidence of PW1, PW2 and PW3 was sufficient to identify who caused the injury to the eye of the accused and how it was caused.

__paragraph__
Ground (a) of the grounds of appeal therefore fails and is accordingly dismissed.

__paragraph__
11\. GROUND (b) OF THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL:

__paragraph__
That the trial judge erred when he failed to give reasons for the conviction and this rendered the whole trial a nullity.

__paragraph__
Counsel for the appellant submitted that where an accused person pleads “not guilty” to a charge as in the instant case, the prosecution assumes the burden of proving his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. He said the Court then has a duty to give reasons why it thinks that the prosecution has or has not discharged its burden of proof to demonstrate whether the conviction or acquittal is justifiable. Counsel submitted forcefully that every judgment must discuss the issues for determination and then settle each issue one way or the other giving reasons for each case why it has so determined the issue. He quoted S. 177(1) of the Criminal and Other Offences (Procedure) Act 1960 (Act 30), the current version of which is as follows:-

__paragraph__
“177. The decision

__paragraph__
(1)The Court, having heard the totality of the evidence, shall consider and determine the whole matter and may

__paragraph__
(a)Convict the accused and pass sentence on, or make an order against the accused according to law, or

__paragraph__
(b)Acquit the accused, and the court shall give its decision in the form of an oral judgment and shall record the decision briefly together with the reason for it, where necessary”.

__paragraph__
Counsel cited the fairly old cases of COMMISSIONER OF POLICE V ASAMOAH (1958) 3 WALR 458; R.V. SARPONG \[1959\] GLR 383 and THE STATE V ANDOH (1962) 2 GLR 106 to buttress his point that reasons for a decision are necessary where there is a conviction. Counsel concluded by submitting that the failure of the court to give reasons for its decision to convict the appellant as well as the failure to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt rendered the entire judgment a nullity for which reason it ought to be set aside by this Court.

__paragraph__
12\. We acknowledge that S. 177(1) of Act 30/60 is the relevant provision on decisions but it is however our considered opinion that the sub-section makes it permissible and not mandatory for a judge to assign reasons for arriving at a decision. This position is clearly deductible from the subsection which ends ... “and the Court shall give its decision in the form of an oral judgment, and shall record briefly together with the reasons for it, where necessary” (emphasis added). This position notwithstanding, there is no doubt that giving reasons for decisions should be encouraged as a sound policy and as a matter of judicial best practice as was stipulated by the Supreme Court in the case of TSATSU TSIKATA V REPUBLIC \[2003-2004\] SCGLR 106 and in the unreported case of this Court inDICKSON KWADWO MANU V THE REPUBLIC, CRIMINAL APPEAL 140/H2/01/2012 DATED 27TH APRIL 2012.

__paragraph__
Failure by a judge to give reasons for its decision may indeed leave the reasonable mind to wallow in the realm of conjecture and assumptions as to why the court arrived at its decision as stated in the DICKSON KWADWO MANU case cited supra or give the possibly unwarranted impression of thoughtlessness, bias or even malice on the part of the decision maker as stated in theTSATSU TSIKATA case but definitely not enough to render the entire decision a nullity as canvassed by Counsel for the Respondent.

__paragraph__
13\. The 1958, 1959 and 1962cases of COP VRS ASAMOAH; R. VRS SARPONG and THE STATE V ANDOH all cited supra are distinguishable. In the COP V ASAMOAH case the court also said “In our view, the reason for decision are necessary where there is a conviction, unless the reason is so clearly obvious and beyond doubt the guilt can be inferred from the facts and circumstances of the case”. (Emphasis added).

__paragraph__
Besides, Section 406(1)(a) of Act 30/60 comes in handy as far as the instant case is concerned. Section 406(1)(a) of Act 30/60 provides as follows:-

__paragraph__
“406. Finding or Sentence when reversible by reason of error or omission

__paragraph__
(1)Subject to this part a finding, sentence or order passed by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be reversed or altered on appeal or review on account

__paragraph__
(a)of an error, omission or irregularity in the complaint, summons, warrant, charge, proclamation, order, judgment, or any other proceedings before or during the trial or in an enquiry or any other proceedings under this act ... unless the error, omission, irregularity, or misdirection has in fact occasioned a substantial miscarriage of justice” (emphasis added).

__paragraph__
We are of the considered opinion that no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred in this case and we consequently dismiss ground (b) of the grounds of appeal.

__paragraph__
14\. GROUND (c) OF THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL:

__paragraph__
The sentence of twenty-five years imprisonment with hard labour is harsh in the light of the circumstances of the case.

__paragraph__
Counsel for the appellant acknowledged the position of the law that the sentence a court may impose on an accused person either at a trial or on appeal is entirely within the discretion of the court. It is also not in dispute that where an appellant complains about the harshness of a sentence, he ought to appreciate that every sentence is supposed to serve a five-fold purpose, namely, to be punitive, calculated to deter others, to reform the offender, to appease the society and to be a safe-guard to the country. See the case of MOHAMMED KAMIL V THE REPUBLIC (2011) 30 GMJ I SC

__paragraph__
Counsel however relied on the case of KWAKU FRIMPONG @ IBOMAN V THE REPUBLIC (2012) 1 SCGLR 297 where the Supreme Court stated that “It is also generally accepted that a first offender must normally be given a second opportunity to reform and play his or her role in society as a useful and law abiding citizen” and put in a plea of mitigation for the appellant. He said the appellant was 18 years at the time of his arrest in April 2006; had no criminal record at that time and that even though the appellant and his accomplice were armed, there was no loss of lives or injuries to the victim.

__paragraph__
The case of KWASHIE V THE REPUBLIC (1971) 1 GLR 448 is very pertinent here. In this case, in collaboration with two other police officers, the first appellant used his office as a police detective to seize a large quantity of goods that had been smuggled into the country. Rather than sending the goods to the police station they were sent to the private house of one of the accomplices for the purpose of selling them for the benefit of all who participated. The appellants and their accomplices were found guilty of stealing and were each sentenced to seven years' imprisonment with hard labour. Counsel for the first appellant argued that the sentence was excessive, submitting among others: (1) that the trial judge gave no reasons for the severe sentence that he passed on the first appellant; (2) that having regard to the value of the goods stolen the sentence was excessive and (3) that the first appellant was a first offender and ought to have been more leniently dealt with. The court dismissed the appeal holding among others that:

__paragraph__
“(1) When a trial judge is imposing a sentence on a convicted person there is no obligation on him to give reasons for the sentence that he passes.

__paragraph__
(2) Since the offence was of a very grave nature, the sentence must not only have been punitive but it must also have been deterrent or exemplary in order to mark the disapproval of society of such conduct by police officers. When a court decides to impose a deterrent sentence the value of the subject-matter of the charge and the good record of the accused become irrelevant.”

__paragraph__
Concerning the length of sentence, it was stated at page 493 thus: - “in determining the length of sentence, the factors which the trial judge is entitled to consider are:-

__paragraph__
(i)The intrinsic seriousness of the offence

__paragraph__
(ii)The degree of revulsion felt by law abiding citizens of the society for the particular crime.

__paragraph__
(iii)The premeditation with which the criminal plan was executed

__paragraph__
(iv)The prevalence of the crime within the particular locality

__paragraph__
(v)The sudden increase in the incident of the particular crime”

__paragraph__
15\. No one will deny that taking another person’s mobile phone at gun point is a serious or grave offence and no one will also deny that law abiding citizens abhor and detest robbery. The incidence of mobile phone snatching is quite prevalent in the country and was definitely on the increase at the time this offence was committed. The modus operandi of the appellant and his accomplice at large, namely, using a motor cycle in order to get away fast shows some strategic planning on their part. That being the case, we think the trial judge exercised his discretion rightly in his sentencing of the appellant. His sentence is in line with the case of ADU-BOAHEN VRS THE REPUBLIC cited supra where court also held that: -

__paragraph__
“Where the court finds an offence to be grave, it must not only impose a punitive sentence, but also a deterrent or exemplary one so as to indicate the disapproval of society of that offence. Once the court decides to impose a deterrent sentence the good record of the accused is irrelevant”.

__paragraph__
16\. The principle of sentencing is not just dictated by case law alone. There are clear and unambiguous statutory provisions on the ambit of sentences. Section 149(1) of Act 29/60 as amended by S 150 of Act 646 of 2003, the applicable law at the time of the commission of the offences in this case stipulates as follows:-

__paragraph__
(1) whoever commits robbery is guilty of an offence and shall be liable, upon conviction on a trial summarily or on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not less than ten years, and where the offence is committed by the use of an offensive weapon or offensive missile, the offender shall upon conviction be liable to imprisonment for a term of not less than fifteen years.”

__paragraph__
It is to be noted that the applicable law provided a minimum sentence of 15 years where the offence is committed by the use of an offensive weapon, guns in this instance, and provides no upper limit. One cannot therefore legally fault the trial judge for imposing a sentence of 25 years Imprisonment with Hard Labour as that falls within the law. Again the relevant part of Section 24(1) of Act 29/60 provides as follows: -

__paragraph__
“24. Punishment for conspiracy.

__paragraph__
(i)Where two or more persons are convicted of conspiracy for the commission or abetment of a criminal offence, each of them shall, where the criminal offence is committed, be punished for that criminal offence. ... “

__paragraph__
We have already stated the punishment for robbery supra and same punishment should be imposed for the conviction for conspiracy since the offence itself has been committed. It is our considered view that the appellant should count himself lucky that the trial judge imposed the sentences to run concurrently. Ground three of the grounds of appeal is consequently dismissed.

__paragraph__
17\. The learned trial judge however imposed the sentence to take effect from 8th April 2006, that being the day the offences were committed. Upon arrest, the appellant was also in lawful custody until 13th June 2007, the day he was convicted and sentenced. It is settled law that sentences are not passed retroactively. Section 315(3) of Criminal & Other Offences (Procedure) Act 1960 (Act 30) stipulates as follows: -

__paragraph__
“315. Warrants to be issued in respect of sentence of imprisonment

__paragraph__
(3) A sentence of imprisonment commences on and includes the day on which it is pronounced”.

__paragraph__
Therefore the learned trial judge erred when he imposed the sentence to take effect from the day the offences were committed. What he is required by law to do is to take into account any period that the accused has spent in lawful custody in respect of that offence before the completion of the trial. This position finds its basis in no other but the Constitutional provision in Article 14(6) of the 1992 Fourth Republican Constitution of Ghana which stipulates as follows:-

__paragraph__
“14(6) where a person is convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment for an offence, any period he has spent in lawful custody in respect of that offence before the completion of his trial shall be taken into account in imposing the term of imprisonment”.

__paragraph__
Accordingly, the sentence of the appellant is varied to twenty-three (23) years and nine (9) months Imprisonment with Hard Labour (IHL)with effect from 13th June 2007, the date on which he was convicted and sentenced.

__paragraph__
In sum, all the three grounds of appeal having failed, the appeal is dismissed subject to the variation in the sentence and its effective date as indicated.
