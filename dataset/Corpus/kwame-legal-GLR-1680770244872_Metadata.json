He further directed that other members of his maternal and paternal families were to be given rooms when they were in need of accommodation, and the house should never be sold. These directives of the testator were followed until the death of executors, when the defendant, head of the testator's family, unilaterally took over the management and control of the house and decided to collect rents due to the estatesAs a result of this intermeddling by the defendant, the plaintiff by an originating summons requested the court to determine the interest of the wider family in the house left by T.M. Other issues that came up for determination were (i) the meaning of \"children\" as contained in the will, and (ii) the liabilities of the intermeddling head of family","indices":["HEADNOTES"],"judgement":{"date":null,"year":null,"month":null,"day":null},"judges":["BY HIS WILL DATED  MAY  TM THE TESTATOR DIRECTED THAT ON HIS DEATH HIS DWELLING HOUSE REFERRED TO AS JEHOVA VILLA SHOULD BE OCCUPIED BY CERTAIN NAMED MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY AND THEIR CHILDREN AS A FAMILY HOUSE HE FURTHER DIRECTED THAT OTHER MEMBERS OF HIS MATERNAL AND PATERNAL FAMILIES WERE TO BE GIVEN ROOMS WHEN THEY WERE IN NEED OF ACCOMMODATION AND THE HOUSE SHOULD NEVER BE SOLD THESE DIRECTIVES OF THE TESTATOR WERE FOLLOWED UNTIL THE DEATH OF EXECUTORS WHEN THE DEFENDANT HEAD OF THE TESTATORS FAMILY UNILATERALLY TOOK OVER THE MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL OF THE HOUSE AND DECIDED TO COLLECT RENTS DUE TO THE ESTATE"],"lawReportsCitations":[],"mediaNeutralCitation":null,"natureOfProceedings":null,"partiesOfSuit":{"Plaintiff/Appellant":["IMPRAIM"],"Defendant/Respondent":["BAFFOE"]},"presidingJudge":"WILLS�CONSTRUCTION�CHILDREN�MEANING OF�TESTATOR BEQUEATHING HOUSE TO NAMED MEMBERS OF FAMILY AND THEIR \"CHILDREN\"�MEANING OF CHILDREN IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES","source":"ghana-law-report","sourceFile":"\\original_source_files\\Cases from 1959 - 1992\\1963\\1980\\IMPRAIM v.
