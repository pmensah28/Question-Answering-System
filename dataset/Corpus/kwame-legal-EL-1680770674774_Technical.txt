HENRY A. KWOFIE JA:

__paragraph__
This is an appeal against the ruling of the High Court (General Jurisdiction) Accra dated 3rd of December 2018. By a Writ of Summons and a statement of claim filed on the 24th of May 2018, the plaintiff which is a company limited by guarantee claimed against the defendants the following reliefs:

__paragraph__
a)A declaration that the 1st defendant is not the company secretary of the plaintiff’s company

__paragraph__
b)A declaration that the 1st to 7th, defendants are neither subscribers nor executive council member of the plaintiff company.

__paragraph__
c)An order of perpetual injunction restraining the 1st – 7th defendants from holding themselves out as subscribing members and executive members of the plaintiff company

__paragraph__
d)An order directed at the 10th defendant from interfering with or altering the records of the plaintiff company without the knowledge consent and authorization of the foundational members and directors as the case may require per the regulations of the Company Act

__paragraph__
e)An order compelling the 8th and 9th defendant to allow the plaintiff company to have access to its accounts

__paragraph__
f)Damages awarded against the 8th and 9th defendants for breach of contract.

__paragraph__
g)Costs involving solicitors fees

__paragraph__
h)Any order(s) which the honourable Court in the circumstances may deem fit.

__paragraph__
The plaintiff/appellant on the same day 24th May 2018 filed an application for an order of interlocutory injunction praying the Court for the following interim orders:

__paragraph__
a)An order for interlocutory injunction restraining forthwith the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th defendants/respondents from holding themselves out as subscribing members and executive council members of the applicant company

__paragraph__
b)An order for interlocutory injunction restraining forthwith the 1st respondent from holding himself out as company secretary of the applicant company

__paragraph__
c)An order for interlocutory injunction compelling the 8th and 9th respondents to allow the applicant company to have access to its accounts;

__paragraph__
d)An order for interlocutory injunction restraining forthwith the 10th respondent from interfering with or altering the records of the plaintiff company without the knowledge consent and authorization of the foundational members and directors as the case may require per the regulations of the Companies Act.

__paragraph__
The 1st to 7th defendants also filed an application for interlocutory injunction on 13th July 2018 and subsequently on 17th July 2018 filed their statement of defence and counterclaim. In their application for interlocutory injunction, the 1st to 7th defendnats prayed the Court for an order of interlocutory injunction to restrain the plaintiff and any other persons acting on its behalf, their assigns, agents, and privies from operating any bank account of the plaintiff company held at the 8th and 9th defendant banks until the final determination of the action and for such further and other orders as to this honourable court may deem it fit.

__paragraph__
In their statement of defence the 1st to 7th defendants denied the plaintiff’s claim and counterclaimed as follows against the plaintiff:

__paragraph__
i)A declaration that the 2nd to 5th defendants to the counterclaim are not directors, officers or employees of the 1st defendant to the counterclaim.

__paragraph__
ii) An order of perpetual injunction restraining the 2nd to 5th

__paragraph__
defendants to the counterclaim from carrying themselves out as directors, officers or employees of the 1st defendant to the counterclaim.

__paragraph__
iii) An order directed at the 8th and 9th defendants in the main action from honoring any cheques or other financial instruments presented to them by the 2nd to 5th defendants to the counterclaim.

__paragraph__
iv) Costs including legal costs.

__paragraph__
The trial judge heard the 2 applications at the same time and in his ruling delivered on 3rd December 2018 dismissed the 2 applications. He however ordered as follows:

__paragraph__
“ Order 25 rule 1(1) empowers the court in dealing with an application for an order of interlocutory injunction to make an order “either unconditionally or upon such terms as the court considers just”. Duly informed and fortified by Order 25, rule 1(1) I believe the circumstances dictate and enforce that the rights and privileges of the parties be controlled, regulated or otherwise limited, in a way, pending the final trial and determination of the substantive action. Accordingly I order, that pending the final trial and determination of this suit and starting from today both parties being the plaintiff and the 1st to 7th respondents are hereby restrained from making orders to 8th and 9th respondents to release funds to them”

__paragraph__
Dissatisfied with this ruling the plaintiff company filed an interlocutory appeal against the said ruling on the following grounds:

__paragraph__
a)That the ruling is against the weight of evidence

__paragraph__
b)The learned trial judge exercised his discretionary power improperly when he failed to take into account the fact that restraining the appellant from having access to its funds would not only lead to the collapse of the appellant, but also result in the breach of various statutory obligations by the appellant.

__paragraph__
c)That the learned trial judge in exercising his discretionary power completely misapprehended the facts of the instant suit when he held that from the pleadings, some of the respondents the 1st respondent in particular, appears to be a member of the appellant notwithstanding the fact that the respondents in their statement of defence had denied being members of the appellant.

__paragraph__
d)That the learned trial judge, in exercising his discretionary power failed to apply the settled principles that govern the grant or refusal of an interlocutory injunction when he restrained the appellant notwithstanding the fact that the appellant had demonstrated that it had a prima facie legal right over the respondents which ought to be protected

__paragraph__
e)That the learned trial judge in exercising his discretionary power failed to apply the settled principles that govern the grant or refusal of an interlocutory injunction when he failed to consider the irreparable damage and inconvenience the appellant stood to suffer, which said damage cannot be compensated in damages, but rather deferred for determination at the trial

__paragraph__
f)That the learned trial judge exercised his discretionary power improperly when he failed to take into account the fact that the respondents did not stand to suffer any irreparable damage in the unlikely event that the trial court holds upon determination of the substantive suit that they are directors of the appellant

__paragraph__
g)That the learned trial judge exercised his discretionary power improperly when he failed to take into account the fact that per the regulations of the appellant, which is a company limited by guarantee, the liability of the members are limited to the sum of Five Hundred Ghana Cedis (GH�500) and therefore even if the trial court were to hold at the end of the trial that the respondents were members of the appellant any loss to be suffered would not be irreparable

__paragraph__
h)That the learned trial judge exercised his discretionary power improperly when notwithstanding his earlier ruling dated 13th July 2018 in which he held that the instant suit was not a derivative action, proceeded to treat the appellants application for injunction as a competing claim between two sets of people claiming to be directors and/or subscribers of the appellant

__paragraph__
i)That the learned trial judge exercised his discretionary power improperly when he disregarded certified records from the Registrar General’s department which confirmed that Titus Tei, Prof Binka and Stephen Tollman are the members and directors of the appellant.

__paragraph__
j)Further grounds will be settled as necessary upon receipt of the record of proceedings.

__paragraph__
The ruling the subject of appeal can be found at pages 336 to 354 of the Record of Appeal. The reliefs sought from the Court of Appeal are:

__paragraph__
a)That the entire ruling be set aside

__paragraph__
b)That the respondents pending the determination of the instant suit, be restrained per the terms of the application for injunction filed at the trial Court and dated May 24, 2018

__paragraph__
c)Such further orders as this honourable Court may deem fit.

__paragraph__
Counsel for the appellant in his written submissions abandoned grounds (a) of the grounds of appeal and accordingly ground (a) is hereby struck out as abandoned.

__paragraph__
Arguing these grounds of appeal, counsel for the plaintiff submitted that in considering both applications for interlocutory injunction, the discretion exercised by the trial judge as represented by the orders he made was made on a wrong or inadequate materials and further that in considering both applications the learned trial judge ought to have concluded that the plaintiff company had demonstrated a prima facie legal right to be protected whereas the 1st to 7th respondents had woefully failed to establish any such right. He submitted that the plaintiff was incorporated by Prof. Fred Binka, Titus Tei and Stephen Tollman who have at all times remained the subscribing members of the plaintiff company and he referred to section 30(6) of the Companies Act 1963 Act 179 to buttress his point. He also referred to the Regulations of the Company which revealed that these three persons are the first directors of the Company. He submitted that the trial judge’s finding that there was a contest over the heart and soul of the Company amounted to a misapprehension of the facts. He referred to the case of 18th July Limited Vrs. Yehans International Ltd. (2012) SCGLR 167 and Vanderpuye Vs. Nartey (1977) GLR 428 and submitted that plaintiff has a legal right which the court ought to have protected. Counsel also referred to Exhibit DKB3, the Regulations attached to defendant’s affidavit in opposition and submitted that the said Exhibit is contrary to Sections 162 and 175 of the Evidence Act 1975 (NRCD323) which requires an authentication of a copy of a document in official custody in this case the Registrar Generals Department.

__paragraph__
Responding to the arguments of counsel for the plaintiff counsel for the 1st to 7th defendants submitted that the main action before the Court was initiated in the name of the plaintiff without the consent, instruction or authorization or any resolution from the 1st to 7th respondents, though they are the right people to consent or authorize the taking of any action including having access to plaintiff’s account and initiation of legal action on behalf of the plaintiff. Counsel submitted that it is not in dispute that the appellant exists as a company limited by guarantee and that a company as a legal personality acts through physical persons. The issue according to counsel, is who are the rightful persons to exercise the powers of the plaintiff Company. Counsel submitted that this issue remains at large until the final determination of the suit and therefore the ruling of the court below is apt as it ensures that the donor funds received by the plaintiff are expanded by the rightful parties absence of which the project funds are better kept intact and accounted for to the appropriate donors.

__paragraph__
Looking at the grounds of appeal, they all relate to the exercise of the trial judge’s discretion and raise the issue of whether the trial judge exercised his discretion judiciously or capriciously.

__paragraph__
Order 25 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules 2004 (C.I.47) governs the determination of an application for interlocutory injunction. Order 25 rule 1(1) provides as follows:

__paragraph__
“ (1) The court may grant an injunction by an interlocutory

__paragraph__
Order in all cases in which it appears to be just or convenient to do so, and the order may be made either unconditionally or upon such terms and conditions as the Court considers fit”.

__paragraph__
In the case of Owusu vs. Owusu Ansah & Another (2007-2008) SCGLR 870 in headnote 1, the Supreme Court discussed the grounds upon which an injunction may be granted as follows:

__paragraph__
“ The fundamental principle in application for interim

__paragraph__
application is whether the applicant has a right at Law or in equity which the court ought to protect by maintaining the status quo until the final determination of the action on its merits”.

__paragraph__
Also in the case of 18th July Ltd. Vs. Yehans International Ltd (2012) SCGLR 167 the Supreme Court per Anin Yeboah J.S.C. (as he then was) after analyzing cases likeVanderpuye Vs Nartey (1977) GLR 428 and Odonkor Vs. Amatei (1987-1988) GLR 578 stated as follows:

__paragraph__
“ We are of the opinion that the Court of Appeal did not

__paragraph__
propose to lay down any hard and fast rule or principles to regulate the determination of interlocutory injunctions. Even though it is discretionary, we are of the view that a trial court in determining interlocutory applications must first consider whether the case of the applicant was not frivolous and had demonstrated that he had a legal or equitable right which a Court should protect. Second, the court is also enjoined to ensure that the status quo is maintained so as to avoid any irreparable damage to the applicant pending the hearing of the matter. The trial court ought to consider the balance of convenience and should refuse the application if its grant would cause serious hardship to the other party”.

__paragraph__
From the provision of Order 25 rule 1 and the authorities, an injunction is a discretionary relief and a court or judge in determining an application for injunction must exercise his discretion judiciously and not capriciously or arbitrarily. The court must also determine whether the applicant has demonstrated that he has a right at law or in equity to be protected. The court must also consider the balance of convenience whilst maintaining the status quo.

__paragraph__
The evidence shows that the plaintiff Company is a company limited by guarantee and the law is settled that even though a company has a legal personality and exists independently of its members, it acts through individuals ie physical persons, usually through its members in general meetings or its board of directors or officers as set out in section 137(1) to (5) of the Companies Act 1963 (Act 179) which provide as follows:

__paragraph__
1)A company shall act through its members in general

__paragraph__
meeting or its board of directors or through officers or agents, appointed by or under authority derived from the members in general meetings or board of directors.

__paragraph__
2)Subject to the provisions of this code, the respective powers of the members in general meeting and the board of directors shall be determined by the company’s Regulations

__paragraph__
3)Except as otherwise provided in the Company’s Regulations the business of the Company shall be managed by the board of directors who may exercise all such powers of the company as are not by this Code or the Regulations required to be exercised by the members in general meeting.

__paragraph__
4)Notwithstanding the provisions of sub section (3) of this section the members in general meeting may

__paragraph__
a)Act in any matter if the members of the board of directors are disqualified or unable to act by reason of a deadlock on the board or otherwise

__paragraph__
b)Institute legal proceedings in the name and on behalf of the company if the board of directors refuse or neglect to do so

__paragraph__
c)Ratify or confirm any action taken by the board of directors, or

__paragraph__
d)Make recommendations to the board of directors regarding action to be taken by the board.

__paragraph__
5)No alteration of the Regulations shall invalidate any prior act of the board of directors which would have been valid if that alteration had not been made”.

__paragraph__
Looking at the reliefs being sought by the plaintiff in this action and those being sought by the 1st to 7th defendants in their counterclaim, it is obvious that the real and fundamental issue for determination in the suit at the trial court is the issue of who are the rightful persons to exercise the power of the plaintiff Company that is to say is it the persons who instituted the action using the name of the plaintiff Company or the 1st to 7th defendants? There is as a corollary to this issue, the question of who are the rightful person to have control and access to the plaintiff Company’s funds being held by the 8th and 9th defendants ie Republic Bank and GT Bank. The trial judge in my view correctly fixed his sights on that issue when he stated in his ruling as follows at page 325 of the Record thus:

__paragraph__
“Now having regard to the competing claims of the parties and given the affidavit evidence and facts of the case it is clear that the respective cases have a single strand running through them and it is who has the right to control the heart and soul of the company called Indepth Network.

__paragraph__
After considering the allegations and counter allegations of forgery and illegality levelled by the parties against each other and after considering the issue of whether the plaintiff will suffer irreparable damage and inconvenience if the application is refused, the trial judge again stated as follows:

__paragraph__
“ As noted earlier on, who has the right to control the

__paragraph__
plaintiff Company is the centerpiece of this litigation and therefore this Court ought to avoid making any definite findings at this moment in time. With that in mind and on the balance of convenience, I hold that it shall not be just and convenient to grant either the plaintiffs request for an injunctive order nor that of the 1st to 7th defendants application ……….. Order 25 rule 1(1) empowers the Court in dealing with an application for an order of interlocutory injunction to make an order either unconditionally or upon such terms and conditions as the Court considers just …… Accordingly, I order that pending the final trial and determination of this suit and starting from today, both parties being the plaintiff and 1st to 7th Respondents are hereby restrained from making orders to the 8th and 9th Respondents to release funds to them”

__paragraph__
The trial judge then made an order for a timely and speedy adjudication of the matter by ordering the plaintiff to file a reply if need be and take out application for Directions within 14 days for the case to proceed to an early trial.

__paragraph__
It is this decision of the trial judge that is the subject of this appeal and the plaintiff/appellant has in all the grounds of appeal and the written submissions attacked the trial judge’s exercise of his discretion. It is worth pointing out that the funds which the parties are fighting over are donor funds. The record of appeal shows that the plaintiff company Indepth Network receives funds from donors to undertake its activities. For example at page 158 of the Record of Appeal, an entity called Charity Projects (Comic Relief) approved a grant of �814, 035.00 to Indepth Network, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation also approved a grant of over $2,250, 032.00 to Indepth Network (page 188 to 192 of the Record) and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) also gave an amount not exceeding �1, 038,305. These indeed are substantial amounts!

__paragraph__
In respect of all the grounds of appeal the plaintiff takes issue with the manner in which the trial judge exercised his discretion.

__paragraph__
In the case of Blunt Vs. Blunt (1943) AC517 at 518 H.L. Viscount Simon stated the established rule of law in an appeal against the exercise of the Courts discretion as follows:

__paragraph__
“ An appeal against the exercise of the courts discretion can only succeed on the ground that the discretion was exercised on wrong or inadequate materials if it can be shown that the court acted under a misapprehension of fact in that it either gave weight to irrelevant or unproved matters or omitted to take relevant matters into account; but the appeal is not from the discretion of the court to the discretion of the appellate court”

__paragraph__
This decision in Blunt Vs. Blunt (supra) was applied in the case of Crentstil Vs. Crentsil (1962) 2 GLR 171 at 175 where the Supreme Court held per Sarkodie Addo JSC that:

__paragraph__
“As to appeals from the exercise of the courts discretion, it is a rule of law deep-rooted and well established that the Court of Appeal will not interfere with the exercise of the Court’s discretion save in exceptional circumstances”.

__paragraph__
Also in the case of Sappor Vs. Wigatap Ltd (2007-2008) 1 SCGLR 676 at 677 the Supreme Court held as follows in holding 2 thereof thus:

__paragraph__
“ The well known and time honoured legal principle is that

__paragraph__
an appeal against a decision based on the exercise of a court’s discretionary jurisdiction, would succeed in only those clearly exceptional cases where in sum the judge failed to act judicially. The applicable principles are; an appellate court would interfere with the exercise of the discretion where the court below applied wrong principles or the conclusions reached would work manifest injustice or even that the discretion was exercised on wrong or inadequate material. Arbitrary, capricious and uninformed conclusions stand in danger of being reversed on appeal”

__paragraph__
The fundamental question for determination in this appeal is whether the appellant succeeded in establishing all the factors necessary to prove that the trial Court exercised its discretion wrongly. We are of the view that having gone through the record of appeal and the written submissions of counsel, that the trial judge exercised his discretion properly and took into consideration all the relevant matters and came to the correct conclusions. Before we are done we must refer to relief (f) of the plaintiff’s claim wherein it asked for

__paragraph__
“ (f) An order compelling the 8th and 9th defendants to allow

__paragraph__
the plaintiff company to have access to its accounts”.

__paragraph__
In the application for an order of interlocutory injunction, dated 7th June 2018 the plaintiff sought amongst the interim reliefs,

__paragraph__
“(e) An order of mandatory injunction compelling the 8th and

__paragraph__
9th defendants to allow the plaintiff Company to have access to its accounts”

__paragraph__
Clearly if the trial judge had granted interim relief (e), that would have amounted to a determination of relief (f) as endorsed on the plaintiffs writ of summons. That in our view would have been improper having regard to the issues to be determined in the substantive suit.

__paragraph__
On the whole we find no merit in the plaintiff appeal and same is dismissed in its entirety.
