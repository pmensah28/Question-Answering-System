JUDGMENT OF SARKODEE J.

__paragraph__
The plaintiff who is employed by the co-defendants, the Prestea Goldfields Ltd., as a machine driver was on 11 July 1974 injured whilst working underground at the said mines. He suffered a compressed fracture of the twelfth thoraxic vertebrae resulting in the paralysis of the lower limbs. The accident occurred when the plaintiff acting upon instructions was working as a shovel boy; a job which was not part of his normal duties. In the course of drilling and shovelling loose rocks a mass of loose graphite fell on him causing him those injuries as a result of which he has been in hospital since the date of the accident.

__paragraph__
Originally the action was brought against the defendants only in their capacity as a gold mining corporation carrying on business at Prestea. After the evidence of the plaintiff upon application made on his behalf the Prestea Goldfields Ltd. were joined as co-defendants. In his amended statement of claim which followed the joinder the plaintiff stated that the co-defendants were agents and (or servants) of the defendants. The defendants denied that they were the employers of the plaintiff at the time of accident. The co-defendants on their part admitted that the defendants were a gold mining corporation but said that they the co-defendants were a subsidiary company of the defendants and that it was wrong for the plaintiff to sue the shareholders for the wrongs of a company. Mr. Kocuvie Tay, learned counsel for both the defendants and co-defendants, submitted that the Prestea Goldfields Ltd. were the owners of the mines and that the defendants as shareholders had been wrongly sued.

__paragraph__
The State Gold Mining Corporation was established under the Statutory Corporations Act, 1964 (Act 232). By Part II of the Instrument of Incorporation of the State Gold Mining Corporation, 1965 (L.I. 400), the objects of the State Gold Mining Corporation are:

__paragraph__
"(a) the mining of gold and the marketing of gold in Ghana and outside Ghana;

__paragraph__
(b) the carrying on of such other activities as may appear to the Corporation to be incidental or conducive to the attainment of the objects set out in sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph or any .of them."

__paragraph__
The governing body of the State Gold Mining Corporation is a board which has power to delegate to the managing director of a mining company the power to appoint persons as employees of the corporation. This power to appoint is reserved for the owner of the mines. It is not denied that the state Gold Mining Corporation appoints the general manager, the chief engineer and the general mines Manager of Prestea Goldfields Ltd. as is required by the Mining Regulations, 1970 (L.I. 665). The daily-rated employees and other junior staff of Prestea Goldfields Ltd. are appointed by the Prestea Goldfields but this does not detract from the fact that the Prestea Goldfields itself derives its authority to run the mines generally from the State Gold Mining Corporation. In order to control and effectively monitor the system of work at Prestea Goldfields Ltd. the State Gold Mining Corporation has introduced a method by which Prestea Goldfields Ltd. sends monthly returns for payment and \[p.208\] other activities to the State Gold Mining Corporation. In my view therefore the State Gold Mining Corporation effectively controls the Prestea Goldfields Ltd., who is the agent of the State Gold Mining Corporation.

__paragraph__
The next question to consider is whether the State Gold Mining Corporation works the mines through their agent Prestea Goldfields Ltd. A company is said to be the subsidiary of another if that other (the holding company) is a member of it and controls the composition of its board of directors, or if the holding company holds more than half its "equity share capital": see the Companies Code, 1963 (Act 179), Sched. I, s. 2. Under the ordinary rules of law a parent company and a subsidiary company, even a hundred per cent subsidiary, are distinct legal entities. However it seems there is no rule of law which says that a company cannot and should not act as the agent of its holders. No problem arises where there is an express agreement as in Southern (Inspector of Taxes) v. Watson \[1940\] 3 All E.R. 439, C.A. where after the business had been converted into a private company the agreement provided that the company should fulfil existing contracts as agents of the seller. Where there is no such agreement it is a question of fact in each case whether the subsidiary company is carrying on the parent company's business or its own.

__paragraph__
In this regard I think all the circumstances must be taken into account the following being particularly relevant:

__paragraph__
(1) Are the profits treated as those of the parent company?

__paragraph__
(2) Are the persons conducting the business appointed by the parent company?

__paragraph__
(3) Is the parent company the head and brain of the enterprise?

__paragraph__
(4) Does the parent company govern the business and decide what should be done and what capital should be employed?

__paragraph__
(5) Are the profits made by its skill and direction ?

__paragraph__
(6) Is the parent company in effectual control?

__paragraph__
From the evidence of the plaintiff�s third witness, the personnel manager of Prestea Goldfields Ltd., and that of the plaintiff�s fourth witness, the Chief Inspector of Mines, there is no doubt that all these questions ought to be answered in the affirmative. The State Gold Mining Corporation holds all the shares of the Prestea Goldfields Ltd. The profits of Prestea Goldfields are treated as profits of the State Gold Mining Corporation. It is the State Gold Mining Corporation which appoints the persons who conduct the business of Prestea Goldfields Ltd. and who are in effective and constant control. These persons are the general manager, the mines manager and the chief engineer of Prestea Goldfields Ltd. To enable it to stamp its control on the Prestea Goldfields Ltd., the State Gold Mining Corporation by its manager appoints other senior employees who conduct the day to day affairs of the subsidiary company, the Prestea Goldfields Ltd. Some of the members of the State Gold Mining Corporation constitute the board of directors of Prestea Goldfields Ltd., commonly called the local board. Besides, the Mining Regulations, 1970 (L.I. 665), make the working of mine the responsibility of the manager who is also responsible for the safety and proper discipline of the men employed above \[p.209\] and below ground. It is clear therefore that Prestea Goldfields Ltd. carries on the business of the State Gold Mining Corporation.

__paragraph__
A person causing something to be done the doing of which casts on him a duty, cannot escape from the responsibility attaching to him of seeing that duty performed by delegating it to another. The maxim qui facit per alium facit per se applies. Where a person is authorised by statute or bound by contract to do a particular job he cannot escape responsibility by contracting with another person to do it. The position is different where the act complained of is purely collateral. In Pickard v. Smith (1861) 10 C.B. (N.S.) 470 at p. 473 counsel in arguing the case purported to quote a statement of Wilde B. in Ellis v. Sheffield Gas Consumers (1853) 2 El. & Bl. 767 as follows:

__paragraph__
" 'The distinction appears to me to be that, when work is being done under a contract, if an accident happens and an injury is caused by negligence in a matter entirely collateral to the contract, the liability turns on the question whether the relation of master servant exists. But, when the thing contracted to be done causes the mischief, and the injury can only be said to arise from the authority of the employer because the thing contracted to be done is imperfectly performed, there the employer must be taken to have authorized the act, and is responsible for it'."

__paragraph__
From exhibit A, (the accident inquiries report) submitted by the Inspector of Mines the plaintiff was seriously injured whilst he was resting near the footwall side of the stope drive after shovelling. The area did not appear to have been effectively barred down of loose or loosened rocks by the senior headman and it appears from the report that the provisions of the Mining Regulations, 1970 (L.I. 665), were not strictly adhered to. The responsibility of the agent is that of the employer and the State Gold Mining Corporation must be held liable for the negligence of the mines manager of Prestea Goldfields Ltd. Whether or not the plaintiff was resting at the time of the accident makes no difference for at the time he was underground and could not have left the mines on his own accord. If indeed he had completed his work, he still had to wait until he and all the others were brought to the surface at the scheduled time. In all the circumstances I hold that the State Gold Mining Corporation are liable for the injury to the plaintiff.

__paragraph__
What then will be a reasonable compensation for the injuries the plaintiff suffered. I will assess damages under the following heads: pecuniary loss, loss of future income, loss of amenities and pain and suffering.

__paragraph__
At the time of the accident the plaintiff was receiving �2.88 a day. This is �86.40 a month. After the accident he was paid only part of his wages and at the time he gave evidence he was being paid �50.00 a month, the highest he had received since the accident; at times it was less. This means he lost at least �36.40 every month, which amount, but for the accident should have gone to him. For the three-and-a-half years he lost a total of �1,528.80 in wages. To this must be added the sums he earned from laying traps and farming which I reckon to be not less than �10.00 \[p.210\] a week. This gives a total of �480 per year. This from the date of the accident to the date of judgment comes to �1,680. This added to the loss of wages brings the total loss of income to �3,208.80. This must be taxed and I will therefore award him �3,000 under this head.

__paragraph__
This brings me to loss of future income caused by the accident. The plaintiff said he was 35 years old in March 1977 but his service record, exhibit 1 shows that at the time he was first engaged, in 1962 he was 25 years old. I think I can safely rely on the service record and find that the plaintiff was 37 years old at the time of the accident. He would have retired at the age of 55 and therefore if he had not been injured he would have actively served a total of eighteen years. His total income based on his wages at the time of the accident would be about �11,600 but it must be remembered that his wages were likely to be increased during the period and indeed the minimum wage is now �4 a day. I think it would not be unreasonable to say he would have earned a total of �15,000.00. I must also consider his earnings from traps and farming which he could have pursued after his retirement. He was 37 years old at the time of the accident. Granting good health and barring other mishaps he could have done those two jobs for at least 24 years. He is totally incapacitated. I will therefore take 24 years' purchase and assess compensation to the plaintiff in the sum of �2,880.00. Under this head, therefore, I will award in the aggregate the sum of �17,880. Having regard to contingencies of life I will reduce this amount to �17,500 for loss of future earnings.

__paragraph__
In considering what figure to award for loss of amenities a number of factors ought to be taken into account. The plaintiff�s second witness the medical officer at Prestea Goldfields Ltd. said when he examined the plaintiff after the accident he was found to have had a fracture of the thoraxic vertebrae or back bone. As a result he was paralysed from the waist downwards and could do nothing for himself; he had no control over his urine and bowels. The doctor went on the plaintiff may not be able to walk again. In his present condition he can feed himself but urinals and bed pans will have to be supplied to him and possibly he will have to be given a bed bath. He has been in hospital since the date of the accident on 11 July 1974. He has since been lying on his back and cannot leave his bed without assistance. The plaintiff�s hip-joint bones are prominent and showing due to the wasting of the spinal cord. The doctor assessed his permanent incapacity as 100 per cent. The doctor was not cross-examined on any of these details and therefore his evidence was not challenged.

__paragraph__
The plaintiff had two wives both of whom left him after the accident and have since not returned to him. He has four children all alive, the eldest of whom is aged about eleven years and the youngest three years at the time of the accident. There is no evidence as to how the plaintiff spent his pastime. Nothing was said about his pleasures the enjoyment of which has been cut short by the accident. Perhaps the only loss of importance is impairment of sexual activity since the accident. For a man who at the age of 37 had married two wives and had four children this should be a serious diminution of the enjoyment of life considering \[p.211\] the extent and the results within this short span. He must be compensated for that. As far as money can do it I think �1,000 will be reasonable.

__paragraph__
The plaintiff 's wives have left him. He may be able to move in a wheelchair but he must be lifted from his bed. He cannot do anything for himself and perhaps worst of all he suffers from lack of control of his urine and bowels. What would he do if he were discharged from hospital? No woman would want to stay with him let alone marry him. His children are young and cannot look after him. Even if they could they have to go to school and could not be with him all the time. Perhaps he will have to engage a nurse and pay him. He may be lucky to count on the help of close relations but if they are to be of any use to him they must give him constant attention and as far as practicable be with him always. Therefore whoever offers his services must be fittingly and adequately rewarded in terms of money. Again taking 24 years purchase I will award the plaintiff �7,600. The plaintiff might not live that long and so I will scale this figure down and award him �7,000. All told I award him �8,000 for loss of amenities.

__paragraph__
This leaves me only with damages under the head, pain and suffering. There is no doubt the plaintiff was seriously injured. Whilst he bent down shovelling, the ceiling fell and hit his back and waist. The ceiling had no support and must have fallen heavily on the plaintiff. He could not get up again and had to be carried to the surface straight to hospital where he has been ever since. He was referred to a specialist at Sekondi where he remained for eleven months after which because of his deteriorating condition the Sekondi hospital advised he should be taken to Prestea hospital. He is 100 per cent incapacitated. He has bed sores as a result of lying in bed all the time. In all the plaintiff must have suffered considerable and continuous pain. I think the sum of �2,000 will be reasonable.

__paragraph__
I would accordingly award damages in favour of the plaintiff as follows:

__paragraph__
Pecuniary loss .. .. .. .. .. 3,000.00

__paragraph__
Loss of future, earnings .. .. .. .. 17,500.00

__paragraph__
