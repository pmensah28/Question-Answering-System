JUDGMENT OF OKUNOR J.

__paragraph__
This is an originating summons taken under Order 54, r. 4 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 1954 (LN 140A), on 8 February 1977 requesting the court to determine two specific issues endorsed on the summons.

__paragraph__
The facts which led to this action are that the late Thomas Marshall made a will dated 28 May 1937 before his death. In the will he devised his house "Jehova Villa", inter alia, to certain named individuals, and further directed: "that both themselves (names mentioned above) and their children may enjoy and occupy the dwelling house 'Jehova Villa' as Family House." Further down the will (and I presume the part on which the argument of the defendant is mainly hinged) the testator directed: "My dwelling house \`Jehovah Villa' referred to in this will should not be sold for any purpose but be a family house."

__paragraph__
It is the complaint of the plaintiff that all went well until all the executors died. Then the defendant stepped in in 1959, and argued that the house in question was a family house and since he was head of the testator's family, he had the right to manage and control the house; he has since that time collected all rents accruing from the house to the detriment of the plaintiff who is the sole survivor of the specifically named beneficiaries in the will. Upon these facts, and in these circumstances, the plaintiff requested the court to determine the following questions:

__paragraph__
Whether "Jehova Villa" is for the whole family of Thomas Marshall (deceased) by virtue of his will dated 28 May 1937.

__paragraph__
(b) If the defendant and other family members have an interest in the "Jehova Villa" that is the extent of their interest.

__paragraph__
\[p.523\]

__paragraph__
It must first of all be noted that the interpretation, construction or implementation of a will really amounts to finding out the intentions of the testator at the time he wrote the will, and those intentions must be gathered, as far as is practicable, from the actual words used in the will by the testator.

__paragraph__
In fact, this is one of the main reasons why the law insists that a will should be in writing. Where the intention is not easily ascertainable from the words as used, resort may then be had to the rules devised by law for the purpose. Secondary, in construing a will - indeed any document - the clauses should be read with reference to each other, unless it is quite clear from all the circumstances that they were meant to be independent of each other. Thirdly, a person construing a will is denied the luxury of conjecture though not precluded from making necessary inferences.

__paragraph__
This last will and testament of Thomas Marshall of Elmina and Apam made on 28 May 1937 by which will he expressly revoked all wills and testamentary instruments heretofore by him made, read:

__paragraph__
"This is the last will and testament of me, Thomas Marshall of Elmina and Apam and now residing at Cape Coast in the Gold Coast Colony and by divine grace, priest and founder of the National Church of Christ Mission, West Africa (Gold Coast, Nigeria and Sierra Leone).

__paragraph__
I hereby revoke all wills and testamentary instruments heretofore by me made.

__paragraph__
I appoint my uncle James Andrew Noonoo Senior of Sekondi, Harry Ghansah and Joe Ghansah (Cousins) of Beulah Lane, Cape Coast, Gold Coast, to be the executors of this my will. I direct my executors to see that my just debts and funeral and testamentary expenses are paid by my sister Effuah Nyaniba alias Johanna Marshall, my nephew Hymond Edmund Anfom and my two legitimate daughters Araba Asiaba alias Catherine Thomasina Marshall and Effuah Takyiwah alias Mrs. Charlotte Marshall Impraim and my wife Christina Neizer alias Mrs. Christina Marshall.

__paragraph__
I give and bequeath to my sister Effuah Nyaniba alias Johanna Marshall, my nephew Hymond Edmund Anfom and my two legitimate daughters Araba Asiaba alias Catherine Thomasina Marshall and Affuah Takyiwah alias Mrs. Charlotte Marshall Impraim and my wife Christina Neizer alias Mrs. Christina Marshall share and share alike, all my real and personal property of what nature of kindsoever as well as any money I may have including my freehold dwelling house named \`Jehova Villa' on the part of the plot of land No. 33, situate lying being at Jukwa Road, Cape Coast with its land measuring 200 feet by 74 feet (two hundred by seventy-four feet) where the \[p.524\] school stands bequeath to the National Church of Christ Mission by me and that both themselves (names mentioned above) and their children may enjoy and occupy the dwelling house \`Jehova Villa' as Family House together with the other properties referred to in this will but their husbands or wives they may marry shall have no power whatsoever or control over the same.

__paragraph__
At the same time should any of my relatives in both maternal and paternal side be in need of residence he or she may be given a room to occupy. My dwelling house \`Jehova Villa' referred to in this will should not be sold for any purpose but be a family house.

__paragraph__
Regarding my mission "National Church of Christ Mission" of West Africa (Gold Coast, Nigeria and Sierra Leone) I hereby appoint and depute my right nephew Hymond Edmund Anfom to be the General Superintendent to manage and control and supervise the same with the assistance of all the ordained ministers ordained by me in the mission in Gold Coast, Nigeria and Sierra Leone and the General Superintendent (Bishop) so appointed by me shall be entitled to all the Bishop's fund due to the Bishop to be paid by all the stations for his support and general oversight of the work vide para. (35) section 3, page 15 of our Church Constitution."

__paragraph__
As I have already indicated, the awkward section is the penultimate clause beginning with the words "I give and bequeath ... "and ending with the words "My dwelling house \`Jehova Villa' referred to in this will should not be sold for any purpose but be a family house."

__paragraph__
I think the first point which hits anyone confronted with looking for the intention of the testator, and which incidentally turns out to be the answer to the first issue endorsed on the summons is that the testator did not intend to leave the enjoyment of the house "Jehova Villa" in the hands of all and sundry in this family either immediate or outer.

__paragraph__
He achieved this in two ways: Firstly, he named the specific individuals who together with their children shall occupy and enjoy the property; the fact that the individuals mentioned are members of his family does not to my mind, automatically confer any rights on the family as a whole. Secondly, he expressly stipulated the interest if "interest" it may be called - which all other members of his family may have in the property. Inclusio unius est exclusio alterius; the fact that he expressly identified members of his family who should benefit from his property is proof that the other members of the family are excluded especially when he went on and expressed in no uncertain terms what the interest of all other members of his family should have in that part of his will which read: "At the same time should any of my relatives in both maternal and paternal side be in need of residence he or she may be given a room to occupy."

__paragraph__
My specific answer therefore to the first question endorsed on the summons, namely "Whether the \`Jehova Villa' is for the whole family of Thomas Marshall (deceased) by virtue of his will dated 28 May 1937" is "No!" It is not. To the second question, i.e. "If the defendant and other family members have an interest in the \`Jehova Villa' what is the nature and extent of their interest?" The answer is that the interest which other members have in the property has been clearly stated in the passage quoted above in the will itself, namely "... should any of my relatives \[and by \`relatives' the testator could a only have meant members of his family\] in both maternal and paternal side be in need of residence he or she may be given a room to occupy." Beyond this, no member of the family outside the category stipulated has any interest whatsoever in the house.

__paragraph__
As regards the defendant, in particular, he does not even appear to qualify for the gratuitous offer made in the passage quoted above. In his affidavit in opposition filed on 12 May 1977 he describes himself as living at Agona Abrem and in paragraph (7) stated: "That I am not myself staying in the said house neither am I deriving any interest from my management of the said house." If defendant is living at Agona Abrem, then I presume he is not "in need of residence" and consequently he has absolutely no interest in "Jehova Villa" at least for the moment.

__paragraph__
As to his own confession that he has been managing the house since the death of the executors, that only makes him liable as an executor de son tort ( i.e., of his own wrong). Any person who, not having been appointed executor of a will, either expressly or by implication, intermeddles with the goods of the deceased in such a manner as to show an intention of exercising the authority of an executor, may make himself liable as an executor de son tort.

__paragraph__
Very slight acts of intermeddling will make a person executor de son tort, for example, receiving debts due to the estate. The defendant confesses to collecting rents due to the estate. The executor de son tort is liable to be sued by the rightful executor or administrator or by a legatee. He must account to the personal representative and will thus put an end to his liability except as regards outstanding legal actions: see Hill v. Curtis (1866) L.R. 1 Eg. 90.

__paragraph__
Mr. Acquah, counsel for the defendant, draws the attention of the court to the last sentence of the penultimate paragraph of the will in which the testator directed that the "property in question, i.e. \`Jehova Villa' should not be sold for any purpose but be a family house" and argued that that meant that the testator intended that on the death of the last of the children of the named beneficiaries the house must remain to the benefit of the whole family because the last surviving child is specifically forbidden from selling it which he \[p.526\] would otherwise have the power to do. Assuming that this was the true intention of the testator, it is not part of the case of the defendant that the last surviving child of the specifically named beneficiaries is dead which should enable the defendant as head of the testator's whole family to take over for the benefit of the testator's family. In any case, I do not share Mr. Acquah's interpretation of the situation.

__paragraph__
I have already indicated that the clause of a will must be interpreted with reference to one another, and what the testator meant by "family house" was made quite clear earlier in the will when he said the named beneficiaries and their children should use the property as "family property" and not his own family of which the defendant claims to be head. The defendant's claims as head of the testator's family affords him no benefit in the enjoyment, immediate, future or contingent, of the property in dispute because the property was not devised by the testator to the testator's family. Who then are the members of the devisee family? Or as Mr. Acquah put it: \`What happens to the property when the last of the surviving children dies without the power to alienate?"

__paragraph__
As a general rule, the expression "children" means immediate descendants and does not include grandchildren: see In re Atkinson; Pybus v. Boyd \[1918\] 2 Ch. 138. It may however appear on the construction of a particular will that the testator used the word "Children" in a wider sense so as to include grandchildren and remoter issues and this may appear in the context of the will itself: see In re Lybbe (Decd.), Kildahl v. Bowker \[1954\] 1 W.L.R. 537. In the will under consideration, the testator obviously a man of a respectable level of education and a minister of religion excluded his family, and devised the property to a devisee family and decreed that the house should never be sold.

__paragraph__
In such a context the word "children" can only make sense and give expression of his intention if it is construed to include remoter issues of the specified beneficiaries. But one thing it does not, in my view, do; it does not let in either the defendant or the entire family of the testator of which the defendant is head. The beneficiaries specified in the will, would therefore take as purchasers and their descendants according to law would on the death of the last surviving child take by descent ad infinitum.

HEADNOTES

__paragraph__
On 20 July 1971, the respondents, principal shareholders of Timber and Transport Co., Ltd. (T. & T. Co., Ltd.) entered into a written agreement with a Yugoslav company whereby the respondents agreed to transfer part of their shareholding in T & T Co., Ltd. to the Yugoslav firm, which for its part agreed to invest in and manage the company. It was further agreed that the name of T. & T. Co., Ltd. should be re-named: T. & T. Kumasi-Krusevac Co., Ltd. Clause 15 of the agreement provided that the agreement should remain irrevocable for ten years, and no member or director of the company as re-named could present \[p.371\] a petition or make an application to the court seeking the winding-up or the liquidation or in any way seek or attempt to bring the existence of the company to an end. Despite the existence of clause 15, the petitioners petitioned for the official winding-up of the company, and the appointment of the Registrar of Companies as the provisional liquidator. At the hearing of the petition, counsel for the respondents raised a preliminary objection as to whether having regard to clause 15 of the agreement, the petition was competent.

__paragraph__
Held, upholding the preliminary objection: the law was clear that every contract was prima facie permanent and irrevocable, and it lay upon a person who said that it was revocable or determinable to show either some expression in the contract itself or something in the nature of the contract from which it was reasonable to be implied that it was not intended to be permanent and perpetual, but was to be in some way or other subject to determination. In the present case, the effect of clause 15 then was that a period of at least ten years must elapse before any of the parties to the agreement could apply to the court under Act 180, s. 4 (1) for the official winding-up of the company. It was not the court which said that the petitioner should not come before it until after the expiration of ten years; the parties themselves had so agreed. Since the petitioners were content to enter into the contract upon that footing, they could not complain if the respondents held them to their bargain.

JUDGMENT OF AMUA-SEKYI J.

__paragraph__
This is a petition for the official winding-up of a limited liability company called Timber & Transport Kumasi-Krusevac Ltd. The original name of the company which was formed \[p.372\] in 1966, was Timber & Transport Co., Ltd. On 20 July 1971, Timber & Transport Co., Ltd., its principal shareholders, Osei Bonsu Snr. and Osei Bonsu Jnr., entered into a written agreement with a Yugoslav company, Sumsko-Industrijski Kombinat �Crvena Zastava� or the �Red Flag� Timber Industrial Combine, whereby the Osei Bonsus agreed to transfer part of their shareholding in Timber & Transport Co., Ltd. to the Yugoslav company which, for its part, agreed to invest in and manage the company. It was further agreed that the name of the company would be changed to its present form, the town of Krusevac being the situation of the registered office and the principal place of business of the Yugoslav company.

__paragraph__
The affidavit attached to the petition shows that the Yugoslav company took up its shares, invested U.S. $250,000 as equity share capital, appointed a new managing director and brought over from Yugoslavia a number of experts to assist in running the joint enterprise. The name of the company was on 1 September 1971 changed to its present form. From that moment, it could be said that the fundamental obligations assumed by the parties under the agreement had been performed, and that to that extent the contract was discharged by performance. In so far as anything more remained to be done, clause 16 provided that the agreement should take precedence over and prevail against the regulations of Timber & Transport Co., Ltd. wherever the two were in conflict, and it was further directed that a resolution to that effect be passed by the board of directors of Timber & Transport Kumasi-Krusevac Ltd. and registered along with a copy of the agreement with the Registrar of Companies.

__paragraph__
Differences having arisen between the parties to the agreement, the Osei Bonsus have caused a writ to be issued in this court against the �Red Flag� Timber & Industrial Combine claiming the following reliefs:

__paragraph__
�(a) Rescission of the contract dated 20 July 1971;

__paragraph__
(b) Declaration that the said contract is discharged; or

__paragraph__
(c) Damages for breach of the said contract.�

__paragraph__
The writ and statement of claim are attached to this petition as exhibits 00.10 and 00.11. The answer of the Yugoslav company is this petition for the official winding-up of Timber & Transport Kumasi-Krusevac Ltd. On 12 February 1979, this court heard and granted an ex parte application filed on behalf of the Yugoslav company for the appointment of the Registrar of Companies as provisional liquidator under section 4 (7) of the Bodies Corporate \[p.373\] (Official Liquidations) Act, 1963 (Act 180), and for an appropriate injunction.

__paragraph__
On the hearing of the petition itself, Mr. Kom, counsel for the respondents, has raised as a preliminary point, the question whether having regard to clause 15 of the agreement, the petition is competent. Clause 15 provides:

__paragraph__
�Upon coming into force and effect as aforesaid, this agreement shall be and remain irrevocable for ten years, and accordingly no member or director of the new company may, during the term of ten years immediately following upon coming into force of this agreement, present a resolution to the board of directors or an application to court, seeking the liquidation or winding-up whether voluntary or involuntary of the new com- pany or in any way seek or attempt to bring the existence of the new company to an end. After the expiration of the said ten years this agreement shall continue in force from year to year, and any member or director of the new company who then desires to bring the existence of the new company to an end shall give in writing not less than one year's notice to the board of directors of any step he intends to take for achieving that desire.� There is no room for argument that by clause 15 the parties to the agreement bound themselves not to seek either in court or elsewhere the winding-up of the company as re-constituted until after the expiration of a period of at least ten years.

__paragraph__
Mr. Reindorf, counsel for the petitioners, however, contends that clause 15 is void because it contravenes the Companies Code, 1963 (Act 179) and the Bodies Corporate (Official Liquidations) Act, 1963 (Act 180). Of the various cases cited by him only In re Peveril Gold Mines, Ltd. \[1898\] 1 Ch. 122, C.A. need be considered in some detail. In that case, a motion was brought on behalf of two of the shareholders of the company to stay proceedings upon a petition for the compulsory winding-up of the company. The petition had been presented by a shareholder holding 5,000 fully-paid shares. One of the two shareholders held 20 shares, on which 16s. 6d. per share had been paid, and the other held 13,600 fully-paid shares. All the shares were of the nominal value of �1 each. It was conceded for the purposes of the motion that the petitioner was a contributory who would be entitled to petition, but for clause 164 of the articles of association, which provided:

__paragraph__
�No petition shall be presented or proceeded with by a member to wind up the company, except and unless (a) by consent in \[p.374\] writing of not less than two of the then board, or (b) in pursuance or by permission of a resolution passed by a majority at a general meeting of the company, or (c) the petitioner or petitioners shall hold, or together hold, not less than one-fifth of the then issued capital of the company, upon which all calls shall have been paid.�

__paragraph__
It was admitted that the petitioner had not complied with any one of the conditions mentioned in the clause.

__paragraph__
The motion came before Byrne J. He was of the view that although section 82 of the Companies Act, 1862 (25 & 26 Vict., c. 89), laid it down that a contributory �may� present a petition, it conferred a right upon every shareholder just as much as if the terms of the section had been that every contributory should have �the right to present a petition.� He held that the terms of the section were intended to confer a right of which a contributory could not be deprived, either entirely or in a modified way, by the terms of the articles of association. At p. 123 he said:

__paragraph__
�The memorandum and the articles of association embody the contract between the different members of the company, but those documents must not conflict with the provisions of the Acts regulating the incorporation of joint stock companies.�

__paragraph__
And he continued at pp. 124-126:

__paragraph__
�. . . the question really is, whether or not the petitioner has by becoming a shareholder entered into a contract, enforceable either by the company or by other individual shareholders, not to exercise the right which s. 82 prima facie in terms confers upon him . . . The article which I have to deal with is really an attempt to fix upon the holder of every share an obligation, so to speak, running with the share, in contravention of the provisions of the Act of Parliament . . . If the articles are to be regarded as part of the terms of the contract between the company and the person applying for shares, I am of opinion that the company had no right, having regard to the Act of Parliament, to enter into such contract as a condition and part of the general contract binding upon all shareholders, whatever separate or distinct bargain they might have the power to make with an individual who happened to be or to desire to become a shareholder.�

__paragraph__
On appeal to the Court of Appeal the decision by Byrne J. was affirmed. At. p. 131 Lindley M. R. said:

__paragraph__
�Any one who is familiar with the Companies Acts knows perfectly well that these registered limited companies are \[p.375\] incorporated on certain conditions; they continue to exist on certain conditions; and they are liable to be dissolved on certain conditions. The important sections of the Act of 1862, with regard to dissolution, are ss. 79 and 82. Sect. 79 states the circumstances under which such a company may be dissolved by the Court, and s. 82 states the persons who may petition for a dissolution. Any article contrary to these sections�any article which says that the company is formed on the condition that its life shall not be terminated when any of the circumstances mentioned in s. 79 exist, or which limits the right of a contributory under s. 82 to petition for a winding-up, would be an attempt to enforce on all the shareholders that which is at variance with the statutory conditions, and is invalid.�

__paragraph__
At p. 132 Chitty L.J. said:

__paragraph__
�In my opinion, this condition is annexed to the incorporation of a company with limited liability�that the company may be wound up under the circumstances, and at the instance of the persons, prescribed by the Act, and the articles of association cannot validly provide that the shareholders, who are entitled under s. 82 to petition for a winding-up, shall not do so except on certain conditions.�

__paragraph__
However, like Byrne J., the Court of Appeal left open the question whether the company, or for that matter the shareholders among themselves, could enter into an agreement outside the regulations waiving or limiting a shareholder's statutory right to petition for the official winding-up of the company. At p. 131 Lindley M. R. said: �I do not intend to decide whether a valid contract may or may not be made between the company and an individual shareholder that he shall not petition for the winding-up of the company. That point does not arise now.� And Chitty L.J. also said at pp. 131-132: �We have not now to consider whether an individual shareholder can or cannot bind himself not to petition for the winding-up of the company.�

__paragraph__
In the earlier case of Welton v. Saffery \[1897\] A.C. 299 the House of Lords had agreed that what may not be made a regulation of the company binding upon all present and future members of the company may be made the subject of a private bargain between individual members among themselves. In the words of Lord Davey at p. 331:

__paragraph__
�Of course, individual shareholders may deal with their own interests by contract in such way as they may think fit. But such \[p.376\] contracts, whether made by all or some only of the shareholders, would create personal obligations, or an exceptio personalis against themselves only, and would not become a regulation of the company, or be binding on the transferees of the parties to it, or upon new or non-assenting shareholders.�

__paragraph__
The respondents have been at pains to point out that the agreement of 20 July 1971 was prepared by counsel for the petitioners. I can well imagine the petitioners as investors wanting some assurance that the agreement would be given a reasonable span of life to enable them make a success of the joint venture. Now, however, they say that clause 15 contravenes section 4 (1) of Act 180, and is therefore void. Section 4 (1) provides:

__paragraph__
�4. (1) The Registrar or any person who is,

__paragraph__
(a) a creditor of the company,

__paragraph__
(b) a member or contributory of the company, or

__paragraph__
(c) the Attorney-General, but only on the ground specified in paragraph (c) of subsection (2) of this section, may present a petition to the Court for the official winding-up of the company.� If, following In re Peveril (supra), we read �may present a petition to the Court� to mean �have a right to present a petition to the Court,� the question still remains whether it was open to the parties to the agreement to say, in effect, that that agreement was to remain irrevocable for a period of ten years. In my opinion it was. The agreement bound only the parties to it. Even if a copy was lodged with the Registrar of Companies it did not become part of the regulations of the company binding upon any existing or subsequent shareholder who did not give his individual assent to it. Unlike the clause in question in In re Peveril (supra) clause 15 was not, to quote Byrne J. again at p. 125, �an attempt to fix upon the holder of every share an obligation, so to speak, running with the share� in contravention of the provisions of Act 180, but part of a private agreement outside the machinery of the Companies Code, 1963 (Act 179).

__paragraph__
The law is clear that every contract is prima facie permanent and irrevocable and it lies upon a person who says that it is revocable or determinable to show either some expression in the contract itself, or something in the nature of the contract, from which it is reasonably to be implied that it was not intended to be permanent and perpetual, but was to be in some way or other subject to determination: see Llanelly Railway & Dock Co. v. London & North-Western Railway Co. (1873) 8 Ch.App. 942 at pp. 949-950 per \[p.377\] James L.J. The effect of clause 15, then, is that a period of at least ten years must elapse before any of the parties to the agreement can apply to the court under Act 180, s. 4 (1) for the official winding-up of the company. Here, if I may borrow the words of the Earl of Reading C.J. in Eaglesham v. McMaster \[1920\] 2 K.B. 169, it is not the court which says that the petitioners shall not come before it until after the expiration of ten years; the parties themselves have so agreed. Since the petitioners were content to enter into the contract upon that footing they cannot complain if the respondents hold them to their bargain.

__paragraph__
It may well be that the action commenced by the Osei Bonsus cannot succeed without a winding-up order being made, but as far as the objection taken by Mr. Kom to these proceedings is concerned, I am of the view that it is unanswerable and must be upheld. The application for the official winding-up of the company is accordingly dismissed, and the interim orders made by this court on 12 February 1979 are discharged.
