On 8 March 1990 the Supreme Court by a four to one majority decision (see Nartey-Tokoli v Volta Aluminium Co Ltd (No 2) \[1989-90\] 2 GLR 341, SC ante) allowed the plaintiffs' appeal in part and dismissed the defendants' cross-appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered on 20 December 1988 (see Nartey-Tokoli v Volta Aluminium Co Ltd \[1987-88\] 2 GLR 532, CA) which had allowed the plaintiffs' appeal in part and dismissed the defendants' cross-appeal from the decision of the trail judge, Benin J. By the said judgment, the Supreme Court held, inter alia, that in purporting to declare redundancy, the defendants, the employers, had failed to follow the procedural machinery set up under the collective agreement entered into by the parties in breach of section 10 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1965 (Act 299) and that the plaintiffs, the employees, were entitled to a declaration that the purported termination of their employment was null and void and of no effect and that the trial High Court and the Court of Appeal had erred in holding otherwise. The Supreme Court further held that the plaintiffs were entitled to receive their salaries from the dates they ceased to receive them to the dates of their respective de facto termination, including an additional twelve months' salary (awarded by the trial court) as damages for wrongful dismissal as at the respective dates of the de facto termination of their employment. It was also held that as the termination of their employment was held to be void, they remained employees de jure and would therefore be entitled to earned leave allowance, bonus, including food packages and all other benefits said to be enjoyed on a so-called gentleman agreement basis - all of which should be converted into cash if feasible as at the respective dates of the plaintiffs' de facto dismissal. It was also held that in calculating their entitlements, accounts should be taken of any period within which any employee had obtained employment within the relevant period covered by the award. In the instant application by the plaintiffs for a review \[p.514\] of the majority judgment of the Supreme Court, counsel for the plaintiffs argued, inter alia, that: (i) having declared their dismissal a nullity, the plaintiffs remained de jure in the employment of the defendants and therefore the Supreme Court, at best, should have ordered the payment of their salaries and other entitlements up to the date of the judgment as damages for unlawful dismissal and not the mere twelve months' salary granted by the trial court and affirmed by the Supreme Court; (ii) that in any event, the plaintiffs were entitled to nothing less than two years' salary as damages following the decision of the Court of Appeal in Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board v Agbettoh \[1984-86\] 1 GLR 122, CA; and (iii) since courts could grant an injunction or order specific performance in a master-servant relationship, ergo an employee whose dismissal had been declared void and of no effect (as in the instant case) could ask for reinstatement or payment of salary for the period he was thrown out.

__paragraph__
Held, dismissing the application: (1) the applicants had failed to show the existence of exceptional circumstances amounting to a miscarriage of justice.

__paragraph__
Per curiam. Exceptional circumstances have not been defined and although the parameters are loosely indicated, and the categories have neither been listed nor closed, they are not wide enough to admit of inappropriate and undeserving cases.

__paragraph__
Per Osei-Hwere JSC. The invitation to review the order that account should be taken of any periods within which an employee has obtained employment in calculating the awards cannot be entertained as it is firmly rooted in the ordinary contractual rules as to mitigation of damages. Secretary of State for Employment v Wilson \[1978\] 3 All ER 137 cited.

__paragraph__
Per Aikins JSC. I have considered ... the argument of counsel for the applicants, and regret that I am not at all convinced to accede to the application. In my view he tried to use the application for review for an interpretation of the court's decision and for academic purposes aimed at breaking new grounds in law. There has not been any fundamental and basic error which this court has inadvertently committed. And it has not been shown that the trial judge \[by his decision affirmed by the Supreme Court\] acted under a misapprehension of fact by giving weight to irrelevant or unapproved matters or omitted to take relevant matters into consideration.

__paragraph__
(2) Per Francois JSC, Amua-Sekyi JSC and Ofori-Boateng JA. The two-years salary award as damages for unlawful dismissal made in the Agbettoh case, was a reasonable compromise - not a rule of thumb for every case that attracted the Agbettoh principle. Where the period was certain (as in the instant case, with twelve or fourteen months as the expected period of lay-offs) it was unnecessary to determine the reasonable period. The time stated was itself definitive of reasonableness. Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board v Agbettoh \[1984-86\] 1 GLR 122, CA explained.

__paragraph__
Per Francois JSC. One must point out also that the pretensions of the applicants to be still employed by the defendants because their termination has been declared null and void, misreads completely the ratio in the Agbettoh case...The fetish or magic that the applicants attach to the two-year award in the Agbettoh case also beats all comprehension. In the Agbettoh case, the court thought it unrealistic to award to the parties who had illegally been laid off for several years, compensation computed as regular earnings for unearned work. It was equally unrealistic to reinstate such parties in former jobs already filled by other staff over the years. Fairness and the need to avoid absurdity, dictated a middle course to ensure a just solatium in keeping with known circumstances.

__paragraph__
\[p.515\]

__paragraph__
Per Osei-Hwere JSC. In the situation where the defendants were hit by a force majeure and were under a constraint to embark on a redundancy exercise, the plaintiffs could not have sued either for an injunction to restrain the defendants from dismissing them or specific performance. The remedy for their "illegal" dismissal truly lay in damages.

JUDGMENT OF FRANCOIS JSC.

__paragraph__
On 8 March 1990 the Supreme Court delivered its decision in the above appeal: (see \[1989-90\] 2 GLR 341, SC). Before 26 November 1987 that decision would have conclusively ended this protracted matter. The significance of 26 November 1987 is that it marked the advent of an epoch-making decision: the ruling in Fosuhene v Pomaa \[1987-88\] 2 GLR 105, SC which held that this Court had power to review its own judgments and consequently formulated tests for the institution of the review jurisdiction. Since then, a number of applications for review have been determined by this court. The synthesised ratio for success is the existence of exceptional circumstances negating the soundness of a decision and compelling its vacation to obviate a miscarriage of justice.

__paragraph__
The review jurisdiction, it has been emphasised ad nauseam, is not another avenue for appeal or a forum for canvassing lost causes. Unfortunately, if the statistics are any guide, this appears to be the erroneous perception of a number of litigants. Exceptional circumstances have not been defined and although the parameters are loosely indicated, and the categories have neither been listed nor closed, they are not wide enough to admit inappropriate and undeserving cases. The absence of a rigid definition notwithstanding, what is exceptional can hardly escape notice. A few examples have been given in previous rulings of this court and need no reiteration.

__paragraph__
This court normally would resist the temptation of being drawn into expatiating on its judgment with explanations or justifications. This inhibition cannot, however, extend over mischievous or wilful misreading of all important precedent upon which a decision rests.

__paragraph__
In Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board v Agbettoh \[1984-86\] 1 GLR 122, CA, the court made pronouncements which ensured that statutorily protected contracts would retain their protection under the aegis of the court's jurisdiction. This decision in certain areas, deviated from the beaten track of master and servant contractual relationships well-known in Anglo-American jurisprudence. The applicants herein aridly dismiss the Agbettoh decision as affording no legal solace. That decision is repudiated as: "not founded on any principle known to the law", and occasioning "a fundamental error."

__paragraph__
If that were the case, one wonders why an exercise for a review has been embarked upon at all. For it was upon the superstructure of Agbettoh that the applicants' victory was founded. One must point out also that the pretensions of the applicants to be still employed by the defendants, Valco, because their termination has been declared null \[p.517\] and void, misreads completely the ratio in the Agbettoh case. The intervention of the court upon the applicants' institution of a claim in legal proceedings, brought an end to the status held by the parties prior to the suit. The court merely moved on to make just awards from a de facto situation.

__paragraph__
The fetish or magic that the applicants attach to the two-year award in the Agbettoh case, also beats all comprehension. In the Agbettoh case, the court thought it unrealistic to award to the parties who had illegally been laid off for several years, compensation computed as regular earnings for unearned work. It was equally unrealistic to reinstate such parties in former jobs already filled by other staff over the years. Fairness and the need to avoid absurdity, dictated a middle course to ensure a just solatium in keeping with known circumstances.

__paragraph__
A two-year award was a reasonable compromise, not a rule of thumb for every case that attracted the Agbettoh principle. Where the period is certain, as in the instant case, with twelve months or fourteen months as the expected period of lay offs, no arithmetic is required to determine a reasonable period. The time stated is itself definitive of reasonableness. In the calculation of the three batches of employees laid off at various dates, it is agreed that a mathematical error occurred in computing the third batch as deserving a twelve-month award instead of fourteen. This error could have been corrected under the slip rule for which provision has been made under article 116 (4) of the Constitution, 1979. There was no need for a full blown review.

__paragraph__
I set out accordingly, what I consider a relevant extract in the Agbettoh case (supra) at 131-132:

__paragraph__
"It follows that in so far as the plaintiffs sought to have it declared that their purported retirements were a nullity inasmuch as they violated a constitutional injunction, they were entitled to that declaration. The plaintiffs did not themselves seek the declarations in those terms and beyond stating that the respondents were \`entitled to all the reliefs indorsed on their writ', the judge below did not direct his mind to the declarations sought. But inasmuch as what we have held can be said to be the substance of the declaratory reliefs granted to the plaintiffs, we affirm them.

__paragraph__
With regard to the claim in the nature of perpetual injunction to restrain the board from ejecting them from their bungalows and the payment of salaries, we see some practical difficulties. It would be unreal to assume that the status quo in 1979 still exists five years afterwards in 1984. Clearly, the plaintiffs have not \[p.518\] worked for the board all these years. They themselves were under an obligation to minimise their losses by seeking and obtaining alternative jobs. For all we know, they may well have found themselves other jobs and have been comfortably settled. To affirm today an order which secures them bungalows which they only had when they were in the actual service of the board or to order that salaries be paid to them for those years when they did not work for the board, albeit through no fault of their own, would be to set our face against realities. The reality of the situation is that although de jure they are still technically in the service of the board, de facto they have ceased to be so since November 1979.

__paragraph__
In all the circumstances, we think we should mark our disapproval of their unconstitutional retirement by ordering that the appellant board pay each as compensation, two years' salary from November 1979. They should also, of course, receive their other entitlements under their contracts of service or under the board's scheme. In so far as the judge's orders properly construed, enjoin the board to keep them as it were perpetually in their residential accommodation and to pay them salaries and other benefits as if they were in actual rather than constructive service of the board, those orders ought not to be allowed to stand. We disaffirm and set them aside."

__paragraph__
It is a basic requirement for all courts which practice equity, to deny unjust enrichment to all suitors. No court should allow unmerited largesse to the detriment of an innocent party. It was upon this well-known notion of fairness that this court declared that those plaintiffs who had secured employment before the dates stated in their respective "Leave of absence without pay/recall" (LOA) programmes-which had been negotiated between the defendants and the local union of the Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union of the Trades Union Congress of Ghana (ICU) had run out, would have such earnings taken into account in the final calculation of their just deserts. Indeed it is trite law that the applicants herein had a duty to mitigate their losses. It would therefore have been illogical and a legal breach if such earnings were not subject to deductions.

__paragraph__
Finally, this court ordered the parties to appear before the High Court for their entitlements to be calculated. It is patent that all entitlements are open for consideration at that forum, even the indices of money depreciation. Save for the correction affecting the fourteen months' entitlement of the third batch of employees who were laid off, I think this application is without merit and must be dismissed.

JUDGMENT OF OSEI-HWERE JSC.

__paragraph__
The applicants' motion prays for a review of the judgment of this court delivered on 8 March 1990: see \[1989-90\] 2 GLR 341, SC ante. The judgment varied, to the advantage of the applicants, the decision of the Court of Appeal. It particularly decreed, contrary to the opinion of the Court of Appeal and of the trial court, that the termination of the appointments of all the plaintiff-applicants including an unspecified number who were trainees, was null and void. The two courts below had dismissed the action as against the trainees and had held that the dismissal of the successful plaintiffs was only wrongful and not void. The Court of Appeal had, by obvious inadvertence, seemingly confined its pecuniary awards on to those of the first batch of dismissed employees so entitled to the said awards but the judgment of this court had corrected the error and extended the awards to all the employees of the second and third batches as well.

__paragraph__
The period during which the employees were forced to stay at home in terms of the LOA programme presented no difficulty. All the three graduated courts were in common agreement that the successful plaintiffs were to be paid their salaries and other entitlements for that period. Both the trial court and the Court of Appeal allowed an additional two months' salary in lieu of notice. This court rejected the two months' salary. The trial judge additionally allowed, by way of damages, twelve months' salary. The Court of Appeal whittled it down to four months' salary. The decision of this court, however, restored the twelve months awarded by the court of first instance. On top of these awards it revived and allowed the claim of the plaintiffs based on the so-called "gentleman's agreement" such as the food packages, which the two courts below had rejected. Like the Court of Appeal, this court also allowed the plaintiffs their entitlements under article 40 of the collective agreement.

__paragraph__
One would have thought that, having retrieved large chunks of their benefits thrown away, the plaintiffs would have found final contentment. But not so the implacable plaintiffs. They hunger for more benefits and to be satisfied they call for a review of those parts of the judgment of this court which dissatisfy them. They have set these down as follows:

__paragraph__
"(a) The order that the plaintiffs' salaries, benefits and entitlements be paid effective from the respective dates of the Plaintiff's de facto terminations, ie 31 October 1982, 6 February 1984, and 15 November 1984.

__paragraph__
\[p.520\]

__paragraph__
(b) The order awarding the plaintiffs only twelve months' salary as damages for wrongful dismissal from the effective dates of their \`wrongful dismissal.'

__paragraph__
(c) The order tending to restrict \`all other benefits' to those said to be enjoyed under a so-called gentleman's agreement (which might rashly be interpreted by the defendants to exclude the bi-annual supply of cloths, VIP entitlement, proven hospitalisation, proven children's educational and also medical expenses, etc.)

__paragraph__
(d) The order for payment of their other entitlements under article 40.

__paragraph__
(e) The order that the third batch of the plaintiffs were laid off between 16 November 1983-15 November 1984.

__paragraph__
(f) The order that account should be taken of any periods within which an employee had obtained employment covered by these awards in calculating the awards."

__paragraph__
The thrust of the argument of counsel for the applicants in support was that since this court decreed the termination of the appointments of the plaintiffs to be null and void the effect was that even as at the date of the said decision they remained still in the employment of the defendants. Consequently this court, at best, should have ordered the payment of their salaries and other entitlements up to the date of judgment by way of damages and not the mere salary for twelve months as ordered. In the case of the first batch of dismissed employees, for instance, they would have scored a period of 34 months from the date of the so-called de facto termination of their appointments to the date of judgment for the purpose of calculating their salaries and entitlements.

__paragraph__
It was contended that, at worst, the employees should have been entitled to nothing less than two years' salary (and entitlements) following the decision in Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board v Agbettoh \[1984-86\] 1 GLR 122, CA-recognised by this court as the king-bolt directing its award of damages to the plaintiffs.

__paragraph__
Granted the self-conviction of the applicants in the justice of their motion for review, it is quite obvious that it (the motion) was motivated by their lustful flirtation with the collective agreement contained in exhibit F. The said exhibit F which took effect from I September 1986 replaced exhibit A and provided for more enhanced conditions of service. It stands to reason that the applicants could only benefit under the enhanced exhibit F if this court could be persuaded to stretch the period for the calculation of damages over and above the effective date of exhibit F. The defendant-respondents oppose the motion on the ground that the judgment touching those matters \[p.521\] complained of do not contain any fundamental and basic error giving rise to a gross miscarriage of justice. On the contrary, they made bold to say that if there should be any review at all it should, for instance, be for the purpose of correcting the error of making an award based on the gentleman's agreement which, according to the defendants, was clearly not justiciable and had no foundation in contract.

__paragraph__
Some recent decisions of this court have exposed the paradigm for invoking its review jurisdiction. And here I refer particularly to decisions like Fosuhene v Pomaa \[1987-88\] 2 GLR 105, SC and Mechanical Lloyd Assembly Plant Ltd v Nartey \[1987-88\] 2 GLR 598, SC. The central theme of these decisions is that the applicant must be able to point at some exceptional circumstances giving rise to a miscarriage of justice before the Supreme Court will be inclined to review its own decision. Although the Supreme Court may not use its review jurisdiction to embark on an apologia, yet I cannot wholly resist the temptation to consider the instant application, if only to chase away some of the lingering cobwebs floating in the minds of the disputants.

__paragraph__
In this regard it will be useful to appreciate the status of the plaintiffs. At common law there is no requirement that an employer should proceed in a particular manner before he dismisses an employee. There is no obligation to comply with the rules of natural justice: see Ridge v Baldwin \[1964\] AC 40, HL; and the failure to warn, consult or allow an employee to state his case prior to dismissal cannot affect the validity of his dismissal: see Pepper v Webb \[1969\], 2 All ER 216, CA and Wilson v Racher \[1974\] ICR 428. The only situation in which the common law guarantees procedural rights to working people is where it can be established that there is an element of public employment or service, or some degree of statutory regulation, or that the employment is something in the character of an office: see Mallock v Aberdeen Corporation \[1971\] 2 All ER 1278, HL. The plaintiffs held no public offices which gave them basic rights to the security of their jobs. The collective agreement which permitted the employer's right to terminate an employee's appointment with notice did not assure the plaintiffs their basic rights to the security of their jobs. Rather, by confirming a collective agreement, the Industrial Relations Act, 1965 (Act 299) accords all workmen that come within the ambit of the legislation, procedural rights or safeguards which are, without doubt, a considerable advance towards building for employees a more secure form of job rights.

__paragraph__
The dispute that resulted in the final judgment for which a review is now being sought was, to me, unfortunate to the extreme. It focused on how in the complex field of employment protection a procedural \[p.522\] arm of industrial relations law could strike with a resounding slap at even the most conscientious and fair-minded employer who in handling redundancy dismissals, was concerned in formulating a "survival plan" with the local representatives of the workers themselves. Be that as it may, our decision that the breach of the statutory procedure rendered the dismissals of the plaintiffs a nullity was no ground to disturb the quantum of the damages awarded (except to correct an arithmetical error) and expand it up to the date of judgment.

__paragraph__
In the statements filed on behalf of the plaintiffs before the appeal came to be heard their counsel spared no pains in fully arguing the case for the payment of salaries up to the date of judgment. The review application sought to reargue the same case. It had been contended, by relying on a number of foreign authorities, that the courts could grant an injunction or order specific performance in a master-servant relationship. Ergo an employee whose dismissal was void could ask for reinstatement or payment of salary for the period he was thrown out. My reading of the cases cited in support clearly demonstrate that there were special circumstances which invited the courts to make any such orders.

__paragraph__
In Hill v C A Parsons & Co Ltd \[1972\] I Ch 305, CA for instance, the plaintiff was due to retire in two years time and was likely to benefit from Part II of the Industrial Relations Act, 1971 which was about to take effect when his appointment was terminated by one month's notice instead of six months'. The Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff was entitled to interlocutory injunction to restrain the defendants from implementing the notice on the grounds that in the exceptional circumstances of the relationship between the parties and the plaintiff's likely protection by the coming into operation of Part II of the Industrial Relations Act, 1971 before a fresh notice could take effect, his contract of employment was still subsisting and damages not being at all adequate remedy, he was entitled to the interim injunction. Again in Jones v Lee (1911) 106 LT 123 it was held on appeal that the plaintiff had a right to be heard and represented before any decision relating to his dismissal was taken by the defendants who had acted wrongly in purporting to dismiss him and that interlocutory injunction should be granted. Each case, ultimately, must be decided on its own merit.

__paragraph__
In the situation where the defendants were hit by a force majeure and were under a constraint to embark on a redundancy exercise the plaintiffs could not have sued either for an injunction to restrain the defendant from dismissing them or for specific performance. The remedy for their "illegal" dismissal truly lay in damages. Although the courts strive to arrive at what is fair and just in their awards of damages for wrongful or illegal termination of employment such \[p.523\] awards are bound to be irrational as they proceed from the discretion of individual judges and the circumstances for the awards may hardly remain the same. It is only natural that this irrationality is also bound to breed disquiet in industrial relations.

__paragraph__
Whatever be the progressive trend by the courts elsewhere towards shielding employees from undue hardship resulting from illegal dismissals which counsel for the plaintiffs has commended for our espousal, that trend has today been halted in England by legislation to inject some sanity, at least, in the award of damages for wrongful or illegal redundancy dismissal. The relevant legislation is the Employment Protection Act, 1975. Under the said Act, an employer proposing to dismiss as redundant an employee of a description in respect of which an independent trade union is recognised by him, is obliged to consult representatives of that trade union about the dismissal at the earliest opportunity, but in any event where he proposes to dismiss ten or more employees at one establishment within a period of 30 days or less, at least 60 days before the first of those dismissals takes effect-section 99. Under section 101, an appropriate trade union may present a complaint to an industrial tribunal on the ground that an employer has dismissed or proposes to dismiss as redundant one or more employees and has not complied with any of the requirements of section 99. Where the tribunal finds the complaint well-founded it shall make a declaration to that effect and it may also make a protective award which will oblige the employer to pay remuneration for a protected period.

__paragraph__
The protected period, under the same section 101 (5) is:

__paragraph__
". . . a period beginning with the date on which the first of the dismissals to which the complaint relates takes effect, or the date of the award, whichever is earlier, of such length as the tribunal shall determine to be just and equitable in all the circumstances having regard to the seriousness of the employer's default in complying with any requirement of section 99 (of the Act) ...

__paragraph__
in the case of a proposal to dismiss 100 or more employees within a period of 90 days. In a case where more than ten employees are to be dismissed at one establishment within a period of 30 days or less, the period is 60 days, and in any other case it is 28 days. By section 102 of the Act, any payment under a protective award in respect of any period shall go towards discharging any liability of the employer under, or in respect of breach of the contract of employment in respect of that period.

__paragraph__
In Talke Fashions Ltd v Amalgamated Society of Textile Workers and Kindred Trades \[1978\] 2 All ER 649, EAT it was held that the intention of the legislation in dealing with industrial relations was to \[p.524\] compensate an employee for the loss he had suffered by reason of unfair treatment by his employer and not to impose penalties on the employer for his default. It was held further (as stated in the headnote at 650) that:

__paragraph__
"The making of a protective award under s 101 (3) was discretionary, but if an award was to be made its period was at large up to a fixed maximum. The primary consideration in determining the period of the award was the effect on the employee of the employer's failure to consult his union, bearing in mind that, by s 101 (5), the period of the award was to be linked to the period of notice required by s 99 to be given to the union for consultation. Although the seriousness of the employer's default was by s 101 (5), a factor to be taken into consideration and might increase the period of the award, it was to be considered not in isolation but in relation to the consequences to the employee of the failure to consult, and the fact that there had been serious default on the part of the employer did not mean that the maximum protective award was to be made unless the employer showed mitigating circumstances . . ."

__paragraph__
Again in Spillers-French (Holdings) Ltd v Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers \[1980\] 1 All ER 231 it was held that:

__paragraph__
"(i) The purpose of a protective award was to compensate for an employer's failure to consult the appropriate union within the required time in respect of proposed dismissals for redundancy, and not merely to compensate for loss or potential loss of the employees' remuneration. The relevant factors, therefore, in deciding whether to make a protective award were the number of days of consultation lost by the employer's breach of s 99 of the 1975 Act and the seriousness of the breach."

__paragraph__
In my opinion there is an urgent call for reform of the law on the lines of the Employment Protection Act, 1975 which will permit the court to make protective awards within a protected period. It is enough to say that as compared to what their counterparts would have received under a protective award the plaintiffs have exceedingly enjoyed the largesse of the court for which they should remain grateful.

__paragraph__
Apart from holding that de jure the plaintiffs were all still employees and for that reason they were entitled to the food packages and all the other benefits enjoyed on the basis of a so-called gentleman's agreement, the majority judgment of this court did not advance any other reasons for so holding. It is clear that the specific awards made under head (c) of the majority decisions fall under the \[p.525\] rubric of "benefits." The food packages were clearly an incentive or productive bonus worked into the wages structure. This is confirmed by exhibit J. For the avoidance of doubt I feel that it will be necessary to define benefits since the awards under head (c) include "all the other benefits."

__paragraph__
The term "benefits" as employed in an "agreement" between an employer and his employee is in my view synonymous with "remuneration." In S & U Stores Ltd v Lee \[1969\] 2 All ER 417, the court (Lord Parker CJ, Melford Stevenson and Blain JJ) had to define "remuneration." It was held that "remuneration" was not mere payment for work done but was what the doer expected to get as the result of the work he did in so far as what he expected to get was quantified in terms of money. The above definition was, however, not followed in S & U Stores Ltd v Wilkes \[1974\] 3 All ER 401, NIRC. Here the court laid down the test for determining "remuneration" as (1) any sum paid as a wage or salary without qualification is part of the employee's remuneration; (2) the value of any benefit in kind (eg free accommodation) or paid in cash by someone other than the employer is to be disregarded as not forming part of the remuneration; (3) any sum which is agreed to be paid by way of reimbursement or on account of expenditure incurred by the employee to the extent that that sum represented a profit or surplus in his hands rather than a genuine reimbursement of expenditure. See also section 35 (2) of the Labour Regulations, 1969 (LI 632) where the expression "full pay" is defined as "the worker's normal remuneration (without overtime payment) including the cash equivalent of any remuneration in kind."

__paragraph__
I would opt for the definition in Wilkes' case. It follows from the above definition that the value of any benefit in kind paid or supplied by the employer, such as the food package, will form part of the "remuneration" or "benefits." With this test it should not be difficult to ascertain the "other benefits" enjoyed by the plaintiffs.

__paragraph__
The invitation to review the order that account should be taken of any periods within which an employee has obtained employment in calculating the awards cannot be entertained as it is firmly rooted in the ordinary contractual rules as to the mitigation of damages: see Secretary of State for Employment v Wilson \[1978\] 3 All ER 137, EAT. Except as to the minor correction which is to be made in calculating the awards in respect of the third batch, I would also dismiss the motion.

JUDGMENT OF AIKINS JSC.

__paragraph__
The defendants in this case, the Volta Aluminium Co Ltd (popularly referred to as Valco), are a limited liability company operating in Tema, and the plaintiffs were employees of the defendants. Their conditions of employment are spelt out in a \[p.526\] collective agreement which their union, the Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union (ICU) entered into on their behalf with Valco, in accordance with the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, 1965 (Act 299).

__paragraph__
The trial judge, Benin J, after hearing evidence from the plaintiffs and the defendants, delivered judgment in which he held, after a thorough consideration and careful evaluation of the evidence, that "most of the plaintiffs were wrongfully dismissed by the defendant - company", and that some of the plaintiffs who were said to be persons trained by the defendants with a view to being employed at a later date, were not members of the union and were specifically excluded from the operation of the collective agreement. He therefore rejected their claim in its entirety. He further found that the LOA programme was negotiated to cover only those workers who were sent home on I November 1982. The learned trial judge further held that the plaintiffs who had made out their case were not entitled to be reinstated in their posts, and awarded them damages for wrongful dismissal made up of the following:

__paragraph__
"(1) salary up to 1 January 1984, the date by which they were to consider themselves as having been declared redundant under the LOA programme if they had not been recalled;

__paragraph__
(2) twelve months' salary being a reasonable period after 1 January 1984 within which they could seek alternative employment;

__paragraph__
(3) two months' salary for being declared redundant without notice; and

__paragraph__
(4) leave allowance, bonus, long service awards as at the date they were sent home, provided these were earned, but had not been already paid to them."

__paragraph__
He excluded claims for food packages and other claims founded on what the plaintiffs referred to as a gentleman's agreement and which they contended they would have been entitled to if they had not been dismissed. He ordered that they should refund the amounts they received as loans in the implementation of the LOA programme.

__paragraph__
From this judgment both the plaintiffs and the defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal. The plaintiffs' complaint covered the following matters:

__paragraph__
(1) The decision that trainees among the plaintiffs were not employees.

__paragraph__
(2) The decision that the termination of the respective appointments of the plaintiffs were only wrongful and not void.

__paragraph__
(3) The decision that the food packages did not form part of the plaintiffs' enforceable conditions of service.

__paragraph__
\[p.527\]

__paragraph__
(4) The restriction of the compensation to twelve months.

__paragraph__
(5) Inadequate and unreasonable awards.

__paragraph__
The defendants' appeal covered the whole of the decision save the following:

__paragraph__
(1) The judge's decision in regard to the trainees.

__paragraph__
(2) His decision rejecting the plaintiffs' contention that their dismissal was null and void.

__paragraph__
(3) His holding that the plaintiffs were not entitled to food packages and other benefits said to be due to them on a gentleman's agreement basis.

__paragraph__
By a unanimous decision, the Court of Appeal confirmed the High Court holding:

__paragraph__
(a) that the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs for wrongful termination of their employment;

__paragraph__
(b) rejecting the plaintiffs' contention that their dismissal was null and void; and

__paragraph__
(c) that the trainees among the plaintiffs were not employees.

__paragraph__
With respect to damages the Court of Appeal by a majority of two to one held that the plaintiffs were entitled to four months' salary as at 31 December 1983 in addition to the two months, salary in lieu of notice, and ordered as follows:

__paragraph__
"The parties are hereby ordered to appear before the court below to calculate how much is due to each of the successful plaintiffs as follows:

__paragraph__
(a) Their salaries from the date of termination to 31 December 1983 and all other entitlements such as earned leave allowance, bonus, long service award, and end of service benefits as at the date each of them was laid off as provided for under the collective agreement ... These to be determined as at 31 December 1983.

__paragraph__
(b) Four months' salary as at 31 December 1983.

__paragraph__
(c) Two months' salary as at 31 December 1983.

__paragraph__
(d) Their entitlements under article 40 of the collective agreement."

__paragraph__
From this judgment the plaintiffs and the defendants each appealed to the Supreme Court.

__paragraph__
On 8 March 1990 this court (see \[1989-90\] 2 GLR 341, SC ante) by a majority of four to one, after an exhaustive consideration of the evidence and reasoning, held that the purported termination of the plaintiffs' employment was null and void and of no effect, and should be accordingly vacated. The court also held that the trainees were employees who were subject to the provisions of the collective \[p.528\] agreement, the moment they joined Valco, and they were wrongfully dismissed, their dismissal being null and void and of no effect.

__paragraph__
This court therefore ordered the parties to appear before the High Court for that court to calculate how much is due to the plaintiffs including the trainee plaintiffs as follows:

__paragraph__
(a) Their salaries from the dates they ceased to receive salaries to the dates of their respective de facto termination which are I April 1984, 6 February 1984 and 15 November 1984 respectively and so in the case of the first batch:

__paragraph__
(i) from 31 October 1982 to 1 January 1984; and. in the case of the second batch:

__paragraph__
(ii) from 7 February 1983 to 6 February 1984; and in the case of the third batch:

__paragraph__
(iii) from 16 November 1983 to 15 November 1984.

__paragraph__
(b) For all the plaintiffs additional twelve months' salary as damages for wrongful dismissal as at the respective dates of their de facto termination,

__paragraph__
(c) Since it has been held that de jure they are still employees having declared their dismissals null and void they will be entitled to leave allowance, bonus, long service awards, including food packages and all the other benefits said to be enjoyed on a so-called gentleman's agreement, all these to be converted if feasible to cash as at the respective dates of their de facto termination.

__paragraph__
(d) Their entitlement under article 40 of the collective agreement.

__paragraph__
Finally this court ordered that the plaintiffs fulfil their obligation to repay the loans granted to them under the LOA agreement in accordance with its terms as to period of payment, if they have not already done so. The court further ordered that in calculating the entitlements, account should be taken of any period within which an employee had obtained employment within the relevant period covered by that award.

__paragraph__
It is from this judgment that the plaintiffs have applied to this court again for a review of the judgment. Mr Jones-Mensah, counsel for the plaintiffs, urged before us that to compensate rights and entitlements declared de jure with only twelve months' damages, can only mean that there is no jurisprudential difference between the verdict of wrongful dismissal and that of a declaration of nullity in terms of relief, and cited the case of Sowah v Bank for Housing and Construction \[1982-83\] GLR 1324, SC, emphasising the rate of inflation in the economy and the decline in the purchasing power of the cedi.

__paragraph__
\[p.529\]

__paragraph__
In reply counsel for the defendants, Mr Thompson who held brief for Mr Bannerman, persuaded us in very strong terms that a party invoking the review jurisdiction of the court must show that there are exceptional circumstances which call for a review, ie (i) a fundamental and basic error may have inadvertently been committed by the court; and (ii) the error must have occasioned a gross miscarriage of justice and he quoted in support of his contention a passage from the case of Mechanical Lloyd Assembly Plant v Nartey \[1987-88\] 2 GLR 598, SC.

__paragraph__
He further submitted that such an application for review should not be used for an interpretation of the court's decision or directions from the court or for academic purposes aimed at breaking new grounds in the law. He urged that the principle on which the de facto termination date was fixed for each batch was taken from the Court of Appeal decision in Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board v Agbettoh \[1984- 86\] 1 GLR 122 CA, the relevant part of which was quoted at 372 ante of the majority judgment in this case . The question, he argued, was considered by the court and the applicants have not shown that there is a fundamental and basic error which has occasioned a miscarriage of justice to them.

__paragraph__
The views of this court on the issue were succinctly stated in the majority judgment delivered on 8 March 1990 where Taylor JSC after referring to the cases of Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board v Agbettoh (supra); Hemans v Ghana National Trading Corporation \[1978\] GLR 4 and the view of Dorman CJ in Harlley v Harman (1840) 3 ER 617, said at 371 ante:

__paragraph__
"It follows from those authorities that I accept and adopt the reasoning of Apaloo CJ in Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board v Agbettoh (supra) and I agree with the views of Archer JA (as he then was) in the Hemans case (supra). In the instant case, the trial High Court judge gave adequate reasons in the exercise of his discretion in awarding twelve months' salary as the measure of damages for each plaintiff. In the Agbettoh case (supra) two years' salary was awarded. I think the well-known practice in the conduct of appeals is that where a judge has used his discretion in arriving at a decision, then unless it can be demonstrated that he ignored the law or took into consideration facts that he ought to have excluded or omitted material facts which should have been considered, his conclusion should not be interfered with. Applying this principle, I am unable to appreciate the reasons why the twelve months' period chosen by Benin J in the exercise of his discretion was set aside and I would therefore restore it."

__paragraph__
\[p.530\]

__paragraph__
I have considered very carefully the arguments of counsel for the plaintiffs, and regret that I am not at all convinced that I should accede to his application. In my view he tried to use the application for review for an interpretation of the court's decision and for academic purposes aimed at breaking new grounds in the law. There has not been any fundamental and basic error which this court has inadvertently committed. And it has not been shown that the trial judge acted under a misapprehension of fact by giving weight to irrelevant or unproved matters or omitted to take relevant matters into consideration.

__paragraph__
As recent as 1962 when this court was dealing with appeals from the exercise of the court's discretion in the case of Crentsil v Crentsil \[1962\] 2 GLR 171 at 175, SC it emphasised that:

__paragraph__
"...it is a rule of law deep rooted and well established that the Court of Appeal will not interfere with the exercise of court's discretion save in exceptional circumstances."

__paragraph__
For example, this court would not interfere with the exercise of its discretion on the ground that the discretion was exercised on wrong or inadequate materials, or gave weight to irrelevant or unproved matters. In this application no significant exceptional circumstances of proven weight have been urged on this court by counsel for the applicants to warrant interference with exercise of the trial judge's discretion. The application for review on this ground is therefore rejected.

__paragraph__
The next ground argued before us by counsel for the applicants is in respect of the order of the court that account should be taken of any periods within which an employee had obtained employment covered by these awards in calculating the awards. Counsel urged that since this is a case of invalidated termination, ie one of nullity and not one of wrongful dismissal, it makes no difference in law whether an employee got other employment or not, and is entitled to the full benefit.

__paragraph__
Counsel for the defendant thinks that this ground is baseless. He argues that as the LOA exercise has been held not to be one of redundancy and therefore to be null and void, and as the plaintiffs have been held to have been wrongfully dismissed, the benefits they would be entitled to under article 40 of the collective agreement would be those accruing on termination on their employment. It is my view that counsel for the plaintiffs has failed to convince this court of his legitimate claims, and this ground of his application is equally rejected.

__paragraph__
\[p.531\]

__paragraph__
The next and perhaps the most important ground of substance argued before us by counsel for the plaintiffs is in respect of the order of this court that the third batch of plaintiffs were laid off between 16 November 1983 and 15 November 1984. Counsel submitted that there appears to be a small mistake in the dates, and invited the court to take note of the fact that the nullified LOA programme was effected on the third batch from 1 January 1984 to 28 February 1985 and not 16 November 1983 to 15 November 1984, ie a period of fourteen months. Counsel for the defendants concedes this arithmetical error in the dates and sees no objection to the correct dates being substituted.

__paragraph__
It is unfortunate that the correct dates the third batch were laid off should inadvertently elude the, observation of both counsel and this court. There is no doubt that the error is fundamental and basic, and has occasioned a miscarriage of justice. The application of counsel for the plaintiffs on this ground for a review succeeds and I order the parties to appear before the High Court for that court to calculate how much is due to the third batch of the plaintiffs as follows:

__paragraph__
"Their salaries from the date they ceased to receive salaries to the date of their de facto termination which is from 1 January 1984 to 28 February 1985, ie a period of fourteen months."

__paragraph__
Save as ordered above in favour of the third batch of the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs' application for review fails to satisfy the test laid down by this court and is dismissed.

HEADNOTES

__paragraph__
In a suit brought by the plaintiff-bank against three defendants "jointly and severally" to recover money loaned to the first defendant-company and guaranteed by the second and third defendants together with interest and other charges, the bank without the consent of the first and second defendants and indeed without notifying them discontinued the action against the third defendant. Consequently counsel for the first and second defendants urged the court to strike out the action against them. Counsel for the bank contended, however, that the phrase "jointly and severally" must be construed not as two separate and independent words conjoined by the word "and" but rather as a legally formulated and adopted phrase with a distinct meaning and which was used in all legal causes or matters arising between parties where an option was left for one party to claim against the others either by taking them together as a joint entity or by proceeding against one or more of such a joint entity. Hence, counsel for the bank submitted that the plaintiff-bank properly exercised an option that was open to it when it discontinued the action against the third defendant.

__paragraph__
Held, granting the application in part: since the guarantors to the first defendant-company, the principal debtor, stood jointly and severally, the effect of the discontinuance by the bank of the action against the third defendant, the second guarantor, without notice to the other defendants and without their consent, was that the second defendant was discharged of her liability and responsibility as guarantor to the first defendant. However, since the first defendant-company did not repudiate the contract with the plaintiff-bank and did not say that it had made good the payment, its liabilities were not terminated by the release of the third defendant and the bank could consequently still proceed with the action against it.

NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS

__paragraph__
ACTION by the plaintiff-bank to recover, together with interest and other charges, money loaned to the first defendant and guaranteed by the second and third defendants during the pendency of which the plaintiff-bank discontinued the action against the third defendant whereupon the first and second defendants applied for the dismissal of the action against them. The facts are sufficiently set out in the ruling.

JUDGMENT OF OWUSU-SEKYERE J.

__paragraph__
On 9 February 1987 the plaintiff-bank issued out of this court a writ of summons against the defendants jointly and severally, claiming:

__paragraph__
"1. �17,597,914.19 being the total of an I.D.A. term and working capital loan granted the first defendant and guaranteed by the second and third defendants as well as ten per cent per annum charge as at 31 December 1986 on the I.D.A. term loan of �1,170,872.15 in addition to accumulated interest as at 31 December 1986 of �7,775,981.95 on both I.D.A. loans the repayment of which moneys has been long overdue.

__paragraph__
2\. Further accruals of interest and other charges on the outstanding balance from time to time of the I.D.A. term and working capital loans from 1 January 1987 to the date of repayment at the prevailing bank rate (on forestry) of 22 and a half per cent per annum or such other bank rate adjustments as shall be made by the Bank of Ghana in accordance with the heads of agreement between the parties.

__paragraph__
3\. The plaintiff further claims against the first defendant alone �384,066.96 being the outstanding balance due and owing from the first defendant as at 16 January 1987 on an overdraft facility of �619,000 granted to the first defendant in June 1984 which facility has since expired."

__paragraph__
\[p.73\]

__paragraph__
The writ of summons was accompanied by a statement of claim. The first and second defendants entered appearance through their solicitor at the time, Mr E. Y. Kumi, on 18 February 1987 but the third defendant on 4 February 1987 entered appearance under protest by himself. Then on 1 June 1988, the plaintiff-bank filed summons for judgment seeking leave to sign final judgment against the defendants on the grounds that the defendants had no defence to the action against them. On 24 June 1988 the defendants through their newly appointed solicitor, Mr Obeng-Manu, filed an affidavit in opposition to the summons praying the court to grant them leave to defend the plaintiff�s action. But before the summons could be heard, the plaintiff on 29 August 1988 filed notice of discontinuance against the third defendant in the suit, and as a result the action against the third defendant was discontinued.

__paragraph__
When the summons for final judgment came up for hearing on 20 September 1988, counsel for the defendants, Mr Obeng-Manu, raised a point that as a matter of law the action could no longer be prosecuted by the plaintiff-bank on the ground, inter alia, that the plaintiff-bank in discontinuing against the third defendant who together with the second defendant were guarantors of the loan to the first defendant, the responsibilities and liabilities of the parties under the contract have been, as he put it, eroded. Counsel maintained that the second defendant in particular has been prejudiced because the bank neither notified the other defendants nor gave reasons for the discontinuance against the third defendant, and that the bank was consequently in breach of the terms of the contract between it and the defendants. In sum, counsel strongly submitted that the liabilities and responsibilities of the second defendant under the contract have come to an end inasmuch as the second defendant stood jointly and severally with the third defendant as grantors to the first defendant, and urged the court to strike out the action because, as he put it, it would be oppressive, unfair, unjust, inequitable, immoral, wrongful and patently illegal for the action to be prosecuted in its present form. Counsel cited the case of Republic v. Military Tribunal; Ex parte Ofosu-Amaah \[1976\] 2 G.L.R. 5 at 10 and 11, C.A. to support his contention.

__paragraph__
Replying, counsel for the plaintiff-bank, Mr Sammy Acquaye, submitted that the phrase "jointly and severally" must not be construed as two separate and independent words conjoined by the word "and"; it is a legally formulated and adopted phrase with a distinct meaning, and that under a contract where the parties intend that they be taken together in any legal cause or matter and not individually at anytime whatsoever the appropriate word to employ is "jointly"; and in a cause or matter where it has been intended that it \[p.74\] should be possible for legal process to issue against one or more of a joint entity, the phrase "jointly and severally" has been adopted. Counsel further submitted that "jointly and severally" is a simple phrase recognised and adopted by the law in all legal causes or matters arising between parties where an option is being left for one party to claim against others either by taking them together as a joint entity or by proceeding against one or more of such a joint entity if he so desires. Counsel also referred to phrases such as "joint or several", "joint and several", "and/or" in interpretation of legal documents.

__paragraph__
On the discontinuance, counsel for the bank submitted that the bank had properly discontinued against the third defendant because, as he said, the bank had the option of deciding whether to take all the defendants as one joint entity or proceed against them severally, or against only the first defendant�the principal debtor�without involving the second and third defendants as guarantors or against the two guarantors without involving the first defendant or against one guarantor alone without the other.

__paragraph__
On the issue that the bank has discontinued without reserving the liberty to come back, counsel for the bank submitted that the bank came under Order 26, r. 1 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 1954 (L.N. 140A) under which there is no bar to bring fresh action, and submitted that if the first and second defendants so wish, they can join the third defendant in the action themselves.

__paragraph__
In this ruling I must pose to myself an evaluative question whether the plaintiff-bank can discontinue the action against the third defendant without notifying the first and second defendants and without their consent, more particularly, the co-guarantor, the second defendant. In fact I was interested in the lecture that counsel on both sides gave to me on English grammar concerning conjunctions used or employed in drafting legal documents. I have made several attempts since their eloquent and edifying lecture to understand the words and phrases used by them but the Oxfordmen did not give me much help when I consulted them; fortunately, I had assistance from the immortal writings of the great law lord, Theo Chorley of the Inner Temple, formerly Sir Ernest Cassel Professor of Commercial Law in the University of London; the man who held the general editorship of the Modern Law Review for 34 good years, i.e. from 1937 to 1971; the man who tried successfully to overcome the insularity of English legal thinking and found room in the Modern Law Review for foreign contributors and for contributions on foreign law. In two of his books on banking, Lord Chorley talked about "joint and several guarantors", the two magic words "joint and several" which both counsel copiously used in their submissions to this court. The great law lord stated at \[p.75\] pages 242-243 in his book entitled Law of Banking (4th ed.) as follows:

__paragraph__
"Guarantees which are to be executed by two or more persons present a number of special problems. First, there is the difference between "joint" and "joint and several" liability. The two main differences are as follows: (i) where a surety is jointly bound with his co-surety, his liability terminates with his death \[see Other v. Eveson (1855), 3 Drewy 177\] but where his liability is joint and several his liability passes to his personal representatives; (ii) 'there is in the cases of joint contract and joint debt as distinguished from the cases of joint and several contract and joint and several debt, only one cause of action. The party injured may sue at law all the joint contractors or he may sue one . . . but whether an action in the case of a joint debt is brought against one debtor or against all the debtors ... it is for the same cause of action�there is only one cause of action.' \[per Bowen, L.J. in In re Hodgson (1835) 31 Ch.D. 177 at 188.\] It is not surprising, therefore, that when a banker is offered as security a guarantee by two or more persons he invariably insists upon the joint and several liability of the sureties . . .

__paragraph__
The form of a joint and several guarantee closely follows that of the individual guarantor. The plural is used throughout instead of the singular, and it must be made perfectly clear that the liability of the sureties is to be joint and several. Furthermore in the absence of agreement to the contrary, the release of one joint and several surety will release the other or others from liability . . . see Mercantile Bank of Sydney v. Taylor \[\[1893\] A.C. 317\]. The rule may be inconvenient to the bank, and therefore it is usual to insert a clause which provides that the bank shall be at liberty to release any surety or to make a composition with any surety without prejudicing the bank's right against the remaining sureties."

__paragraph__
On this topic of contracts of "joint and several guarantees" and allied matters, there is a plethora of legal literature or catena of impressive judicial decisions such as National Provincial Bank of England v. Brackenbury (1906) 22 T.L.R. 797; Polak v. Everett (1876) 1 Q.B.D. 669; Ellesmere Brewery Co. v. Cooper \[1896\] 1 Q.B. 75 and Smith v. Wood \[1929\] 1 Ch 14. A release of one partner from a partnership debt discharges all the others for where several persons are bound "jointly" or "jointly and severally" a release of one is a release of them all: see Granville Williams On Joint Obligations (1949); Lacy v. Kinnaston (1701)1 Ld. Raym 688 and Kiffin v. Willis and Evans (1695) \[p.76\] 4 Mod. 379; and Jenkins v. Jenkins \[1928\] 2 K.B. 501 where a joint and several promissory note was to be discharged by one of the promissors becoming the executive of the premises. See Leading Cases in the Law of Banking (2nd ed.) by Lord Chorley and P. E. Smart at 225.

__paragraph__
In the present case, the second and third defendants, the guarantors to the principal debtor, the first defendant, stood jointly and severally as exhibit 2 shows, and I quote:

__paragraph__
"The loan shall be guaranteed jointly and severally as to both principal and interest by the following:

__paragraph__
(1) Jacinta Soraya Mamih of Mile 78, Sunyani Road, Sunyani.

__paragraph__
(2) Halarius Kwame Ababayi of Plot No. 5 Blk. 8, Dadiesoaba, Kumasi."

__paragraph__
Now as the plaintiff-bank has discontinued against the third defendant, the second guarantor, without notice or consent of the first guarantor, the law says, and I rule, that the second defendant is also discharged of the liability and responsibility of her guarantorship to the first defendant. But since the principal debtor does not repudiate the contract with the plaintiff-bank and does not say that he had made good the payment, I do not agree with counsel for the defendants that his liabilities are also over and that the plaintiff cannot proceed against him in this action. I hold that the first guarantor, i.e. the second defendant, is discharged of her liabilities and responsibilities under the contract. She and the third defendant stood jointly and severally as guarantors for the first defendant but the plaintiff-bank has discontinued the action against the third defendant without the notice and consent of the second defendant, a co-guarantor. However, the action should continue as against the principal debtor, the first defendant.
