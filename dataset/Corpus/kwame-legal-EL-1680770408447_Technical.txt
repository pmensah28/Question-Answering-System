JUDGMENT

__paragraph__
H. ABBAN (MRS.)

__paragraph__
This is a unanimous decision of the Court.

__paragraph__
The appeal before the Court arises out of the judgment of his Lordship Apaloo R. K. sitting at the High Court, Accra and delivered on the 10th day of May 2002. The judgment went in favour of the Plaintiff/Respondent (hereinafter referred to simply as the Respondent). The defendant/Appellant who will also be referred to henceforth in this judgment as simply the Appellant, being dissatisfied with the judgment has appealed to this Court against the said judgment.

__paragraph__
The appellant stated five grounds of appeal filed pursuant to leave granted for the appeal to be lodged out of time. Counsel for the Appellant has decided in his wisdom to argue together the 1st and 5th grounds of appeal.

__paragraph__
These are:—

__paragraph__
“a - The ruling is totally at variance with the totality of evidence adduced at the trial;" and

__paragraph__
“e - The judge made findings of fact that were contradictory and not supported by any evidence on record.”

__paragraph__
According to Counsel for the Appellant, the fact that the judge found that the defendant “assaulted and battered the plaintiff at the Fusion Night Club that evening” contradicts his other finding that “at about 1.00 a.m. on 22/5/98 there was a scuffle between the parties at the Fusion Night Club.” Counsel argues that this “scuffle” was amply corroborated by PW1 who was present at the club. His line of argument is that if the trial judge is certain that there was a scuffle between the appellant and the Respondent, then the party who was worse off cannot succeed in an action against the other party simply because he was worse off in the scuffle.

__paragraph__
His second ground of appeal is that the learned trial judge erred in granting special damages that had not specifically been endorsed on the writ of summons and had not been proved by the Respondent. Counsel’s argument is that in the law of tort, there is a distinction between general and special damages and that one of the distinctions is in the area of pleadings. He supported this submission with the Susque Lava case \[1926\] A.C. 665 where Lord Dunedin stated at page 661 as follows: “If there be any special damage which is attributable to the wrongful act that special damage must be averred it must be averred that such damage has been suffered but the quantification is a jury question.”

__paragraph__
Though Counsel argued at length about the award of damages, both general and special, he finally conceded that if the court is inclined to affirm the judgment of the court below and to uphold the damages awarded, the Court must award only nominal damages in the absence of proof of consequential damages suffered by the Respondent.

__paragraph__
The appellant therefore prays this Court to set aside the award made at the Court below and in its stead make a nominal award in favour of the Respondent.

__paragraph__
The facts of this case are that on the night of 22nd May 1998 at about 1.00 a.m., the Appellant and the Respondent who were then at the Fusion Night Club, Osu were involved in a scuffle. How did the scuffle start? According to the Respondent, he was seated at a table in the night club with some friends since that date happened to be his 24th birthday and they were celebrating same, when without any provocation from Respondent the Appellant approached their table and asked him to choose a leg to be broken whilst insulting him and his family. Respondent had then returned from France where he had just had a knee surgery from which he was still recovering and he was therefore using crutches. The Appellant then slapped the Respondent and he was about to “punch” the operated knee when the Respondent held his (Appellant’s) wrist.

__paragraph__
From the foregoing account which was amply supported by the PW1 (Ali Kwame Maoux) whose evidence-in-chief was to the effect that he saw the Appellant attack the Respondent who was then seated on a bench without any provocation from the latter. This piece of evidence was not discredited under cross-examination nor was any other evidence led through another defence witness to contradict same.

__paragraph__
Thus it stands on the records that a battery or “an unwanted physical contact of his person which constitutes the tort of battery” took place on the Respondent on the night of the 22/5/98.

__paragraph__
In the case of Cole vrs. Turner {1706} 6 Mod. 149, Holt C.J. stated that the least “touching of another in anger is a battery;” and this is still the law. In the law of battery there is no requirement to prove that the contact caused or threatened to cause any physical injury or harm. Thus in the case of Wilson vrs. Pringle \[1986\] 2 AER 440 at page 495 C.A., it was held that “an intention to injure is not essential to an action for trespass to the person which is the offence.”

__paragraph__
Therefore the culpable touching may take several forms subject to the Rule that the contact must be direct.

__paragraph__
The principle in awarding damages is to compensate the “Plaintiff” for the losses pecuniary and non-pecuniary which he had sustained as a result of the “Defendant’s” tort – more specifically the assessment process is said to aim at restitutio in integrum.

__paragraph__
Here we cite the oft-quoted words of Lord Blackburn that “the Court should award that sum of money which will put the party who has been injured or who has suffered in the same position as he would have been in if he had not suffered the wrong for which he is now getting his compensation or reparation.”

__paragraph__
The loss for which the Plaintiff claims compensation must be caused by and must not be too remote a consequence of the defendants tort. Thus in the case before us, the Appellant must reasonably have foreseen that his conduct would aggravate the Respondent’s injury since he knew or should have known that the Respondent was not physically sound considering that he was using crutches.

__paragraph__
In our opinion we think the learned trial judge was right in coming to the conclusion he did in finding that it was the Appellant who “left his seat, advanced on the Plaintiff, slapped him” and when the Respondent tried to escape, “pursued him, punching his feet and leg.” Again the fact that the Respondent was using crutches and had had an operation on his knee in France was also not disputed.

__paragraph__
The cases of Rookes vrs. Barnavd {1964} A.C. 1129, 1221 – 1233 and Broome vrs. Cassel & Co. Ltd. {1972} A. C. 102 both support the legal principles that the time, place and manner of the trespass and the conduct of the Defendant may be taken into account and the Court may award aggravated damages on these grounds.

__paragraph__
This Court therefore does not intend to interfere with the findings of fact by the learned trial judge at the Court below. In view of the principle stated in the two cases just cited supra, we affirm that though it was not the physical assault by the Appellant which caused Defendant’s original injury to his knee; after the trespass to his person, the doctors recommended that he goes back to France for some laboratory tests to be done to assess any fresh damages which may have been done to the knee due to Appellant’s conduct.
