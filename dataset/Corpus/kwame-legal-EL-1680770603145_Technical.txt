JUDGMENT

__paragraph__
HONYENUGA, J.A.

__paragraph__
This is an appeal by the defendants/appellants hereinafter called the appellants against the Ruling of the High Court, Land Division, Accra dated the 29th July 2011. The said ruling had restrained both parties from having any dealings with any portion of the land in dispute pending the final determination of the suit.

__paragraph__
The facts which resulted in this appeal are that, the plaintiffs/respondents hereinafter called the respondents claiming to be the head of the Obeney We family of Teshie and Sraha and the Wulomo of La and Teshie respectively are owners of the Sraha lands and have been in possession since time immemorial. The respondents also claimed that the appellants are their licencees who now claim as allodial owners and obtained a provisional certificate from the Land Title Registry which certificate had since been declared irregular. The appellants had relied on the said irregular certificate and made grants of parcels of the said Sraha lands to others claiming to be the owners of the said land. As a result the respondents instituted the instant action against the appellants claiming:-

__paragraph__
“i. Declaration of Title to all that piece or parcel of land known as the Sraha Lands covering an approximate area of 312.68 acres, the boundaries of which are as follows:-

__paragraph__
On the North, bounded by the road from Ashale Botwe towards the University of Ghana, Agricultural Research Station, commencing from a point marked OF1 in an easterly direction with the said road as a boundary and measuring 980 feet to the point marked OF2 and OF3, and the boundary, like the said University Farm road, descending in a South Easterly direction and measuring between points OF3 and OF4, 180 feet and between OF4 and OF5, 800 feet and between points marked OF5 and OF6, another 800 feet and between the points marked OF6 and OF7, a distance of 1400 feet and the boundary descends sharply in a Southerly direction and measuring between points OF7 and OF8, a distance of 1440 feet with Nmaidzor Village, constituting the South-Eastern boundary and between points OF8 and OF9, a distance of 2010 feet and the boundary taking a sharp Westerly direction and measuring between points OF9 and OF10, a distance of 630 feet and bounded on that side by Otinshie and Dzornaaman Villages and the boundary taking a sharp straight Northerly direction and between points OF11 and OF12, a distance of 980 feet, between OF12 and OF13, a distance of 1490 feet and bounded on that side by Onukpai Wohe, and between points OF13 and OF14, a distance of 1520 feet and bounded on that side by Ogodzo village and farms which boundary passes through a sand/stone pit and between OF14 and OF15, a distance of 680 feet and between points OF15 and OF1 a distance of 990 feet and bounded on that side by Freeman’s land.

__paragraph__
ii. Recovery of possession of the entire land.

__paragraph__
iii. Damages for Trespasses

__paragraph__
iv. Further or other relief as in the circumstance may be just or proper including in particular, a perpetual injunction restraining the defendants whether by themselves, their servants, agents, privies whomsoever or otherwise from dealing or interfering with the plaintiffs ownership, possession and/or control of the said tract of land know as SRAHA land or any part thereof.

__paragraph__
v. An order directed at the Land Title Registry to withdraw any Land Title Certificate issued to any party under any purported grant other than by the Obeney We family”.

__paragraph__
The 1st – 3rd appellants entered appearance while the 4th appellant also filed theirs separately. The 1st – 3rd appellants filed a statement of defence and claimed that they are owners in possession of land known as Adjetey Agbosu and Freeman family lands situate partly between South-East of the Motorway from Nkwantanang to the University of Ghana Farm and partly North-East of the Onukpai Wohe stream at Sraha near Ashalebotwe – Accra and more particularly contained in the attached schedule ‘A’ which boundaries were confirmed by the judgment of the Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No. 24/2002, Adjetey Agbosu & Ors. vrs Ebenezer Nikoi Kotei. The appellants claimed that by the said judgment their family was adjudged the allodial owners of the land in dispute. After stating the history of the land, the appellants alleged that the respondents were estopped from asserting any claim or title to the lands having stood by while the land was litigated from 1993 to 2004. The schedule ‘A’ is as follows:-

__paragraph__
SCHEDULE

__paragraph__
“A declaration to all that piece or parcel of land known as Adjetey Agbosu and Freeman family lands situate between South East of the Motor Road from Nkwantanang to the University farm and partly North-East of the Onukpai Wohe stream respectively at Sraha near Ashalebotwe-Accra in the Tema District of Greater Accra Region of the Republic of Ghana the boundary where of commencing at a pillar marked AFF 20A which pillar marks the North-Western Corner of the said site for Adjetey Agbosu and Freeman family lands and is 119.4 feet on a bearing of 132’30’ further bearing together with all further bearings hereinafter mentioned is referred to Meridian to West Longitude from a pillar marked SG. E9/57/607 the boundary runs on a bearing of 96o 151 for 480.0 feet to a pillar marked AAF.21 and thence on a bearing of 93o 301 for 525.0 feet to a pillar marked AAF.22 and thence on a bearing of 92o 301 for 765.2 feet to a pillar marked AAF.23 and thence on a bearing of 1111 001 for 120.0 feet to a pillar marked AAF.24 and thence on a bearing of 1321 00 for 1450.2 feet passing through a pillar marked AAF.25 to a pillar marked AAF.26 and thence on a bearing of 136o 301 for 790.0 feet to a pillar marked AAF.27 which pillar is at the junction of the said Motor road from Nkwantanang to University Farm and a Motor road from Adiringano to Nkwantanang and thence on a bearing of 179o 00 for 290.0feet to a pillar marked AAF.28 and thence on a bearing of 169o 30 for 300 feet to a pillar marked AAF.29 and thence on a bearing of 181o 00 for 350.0 feet to a pillar marked AAF.30 and thence on a bearing of 200o 00 for 560 feet to a pillar marked AAF.7 and thence on a bearing of 200o 151 for 842.5 feet to a pillar marked AAF.8 and thence on a bearing of 199o 57 for 804.2 feet to a pillar marked AAF.9 and thence on a bearing of 201o 061 for 482.5 feet to a pillar marked AAF.10 and thence on a bearing of 199o 35 for 737.0 feet passing through a pillar marked AAF.11 to a point which is at the Easter side of a pond and thence follows the North Easter side of the Onukpai Wohe Stream for a distance of 4775 feet approximately to a point and thence on a bearing of 190 181 for 1179.4 feet passing through a pillar marked AAF.17 to a pillar marked AAF.18 and thence on a bearing of 19o 27 for 490.0 feet to the point of commencement thus enclosing an area of 351.00 acre be the several dimensions little more or less as the same premises are more particularly delineated and shown edged pink on the certified plan herewith attached”.

__paragraph__
The 4th appellant also filed a statement of defence in which it was stated that it processed a Land Title Certificate for the 1st – 3rd appellants but due to the litigation mentioned by the 1st – 3rd appellants and a caveat received and therefore a caveat was imposed on the Land Title Certificate. It was further stated that the litigation terminated at the Supreme Court whereby the 1st – 3rd appellants were given judgment. Thereafter, a substantive Land Title Certificate was granted to the 1st – 3rd appellants.

__paragraph__
Application for Directions were taken and hearing of the matter commenced. Meanwhile, the respondents filed a motion for Interim Injunction “to restrain the appellants, its assigns, privies, agents and workmen from dealing in any way or interfering with the land the subject matter of this suit”. In the accompanying affidavit sworn to by the 1st respondent, he avers in paragraphs 6 to 10 as follows:-

__paragraph__
“6. That whilst the suit is pending and the matters in controversy have not yet been determined by this Honourable Court, the Defendants, acting by their agents, assigns, privies, and workmen have been developing the land which is the subject matter of this suit. Copies of pictures taken at the site are attached and marked as follows:- ‘OS’1, OS’2, OS’3, OS’4 and OS’5.

__paragraph__
7\. That I am advised by Counsel and verily believe that the conduct of the defendants, even though a restraining order has not been obtained from this Honourable Court, undermines the entire judicial process.

__paragraph__
8\. That the defendants, whiles the matter is pending have been developing the land to the extent that if care is not taken, their conduct shall over reach the purpose for which this action is pending, or was instituted.

__paragraph__
9\. That in the result, I am advised by Counsel and verily believe that it would serve the best interest of justice that whilst the matter is pending, an order of an interim injunction is granted restraining the defendants, their servants, agents, assigns and workmen from interfering with the subject matter of this suit”.

__paragraph__
In their affidavit, the 1st respondent stated that he would refer to the pleadings as filed. In their statement of case, the respondents referred to Order 25 rule 1 of C.I. 47 to the effect that it granted to the Court a discretion to grant an order of interlocutory injunction. They also referred to the classical cases of Poutney v Doegah \[1987-88\] 1 GLR 111 at 115; Tokosi v Abas \[1972\] 1 GLR 257; Vanderpuye v Nartey \[1977\] 1 GLR 428 at 432 C.A.; Food Specialities (Gh) Ltd. v Technicas De Muti Construction S.A. \[1987-88\] GLR 25 C.A.; Frimpong v Nana Asere Obeng II \[1974\] 1 GLR 16; Botwe v Edwey II \[1991\] GLR 179 at 182 C.A.; and Odonkor v Amartei \[1987-88\] 1 GLR 578 Holding 1 in support of their application.

__paragraph__
Upon service of the application, the appellants filed an affidavit in opposition through their Counsel Mr. Ken Brookman-Amissah who averred in paragraphs 3 to 8 as follows:-

__paragraph__
“3. That the respondents are opposed to the instant application filed on 30th June 2011. That the said application is bereft of any merit and lacks sound legal basis.

__paragraph__
4\. That the respondents deny paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 of the affidavit in support of the instant application and further say that the annexed exhibits fail to substantiate the plaintiffs/applicants’ (the applicants) allegations.

__paragraph__
5\. That the respondents aver that the said exhibits ‘OS1’ to ‘OS5’ have no probative value and have been merely contrived by the applicants to provide a false pretext for this application. That noting in the said exhibits establishes any link whatsoever to the respondents.

__paragraph__
6\. That the status quo as of date is that the respondents have been adjudged owners in possession of the land subject matter of this dispute, their claim to title having been upheld by the Supreme Court in the case of In re Ashalley Botwe; Adjetey Agbosu & Ors. v Kotey & Ors. \[2003-2004\] SCGLR 420.

__paragraph__
7\. That consequent upon the said judgment the respondents’ families, i.e. the Adjetey Agbosu and Freeman families, have been duly registered in the Land Registry as proprietors of the land in dispute. That copy of the relevant land certificate dated 26th July 2005 is herewith annexed and marked as exhibit ‘1’.

__paragraph__
8\. That this Court is duty bound to protect the respondents’ title to the disputed land as affirmed by the Supreme Court, pending the final determination of the substantive matter”.

__paragraph__
In their statement of case, they relied on some English authorities, the same Vanderpuye v Natey (supra),Contracor Resources Ltd. v Boahene & Ors. \[1992-93\] GBR Part 4 1512 C.A. at p.1516.

__paragraph__
On the 29th day of July 2011, the learned trial judge after hearing Counsel for the parties and perusing the respective affidavits and their statement of case ruled as follows:-

__paragraph__
“To hold the balance evenly between the parties, all parties and their agents, servants, privies, assigns, workmen etc. are restrained from having any dealings with any portion of the land in dispute pending the determination of this suit.

__paragraph__
The plaintiffs should give an undertaking as envisaged under Order 25 Rule 9(1) before this order is drawn up and signed”.

__paragraph__
The respondent accordingly gave an undertaking which appears on page 60 of the record of appeal.

__paragraph__
Aggrieved by the ruling of the trial Court, the appellants filed the instant appeal based on the following grounds:-

__paragraph__
“a) That the ruling was erroneous in law and amounted to a wrongful exercise of discretion.

__paragraph__
b) That the trial judge failed to appreciate that on the face of the pleadings and affidavit evidence the appellants had a relatively stronger case which should have warranted a refusal of the application for interlocutory injunction, to wit;

__paragraph__
i. The appellants were in physical possession and occupation of the disputed land.

__paragraph__
ii. The appellants legal right to the land by a previous judgment of the Supreme Court which guaranteed title to them unless otherwise determined.

__paragraph__
iii. The appellants were in possession of a Land Title Certificate concerning the disputed land which guaranteed title to them unless otherwise determined.

__paragraph__
iv. There was no proof that the photographic exhibits relied upon by the plaintiffs/respondents concerned any portion of the land in dispute.

__paragraph__
v. The plaintiffs/respondents failed to annex to their application, as exhibit any survey map relating to the land in respect of which they sought the injunctive order.

__paragraph__
c. That additional grounds of appeal shall be filed upon receipt of the record”.

__paragraph__
It is noted that the appellants did not file additional grounds of appeal as indicated in their Notice of Appeal and they are therefore considered abandoned.

__paragraph__
I will start with ground (b). A perusal of the ground of appeal as stated in ground (b) offends Rule 8(5) of the Court of Appeal Rules, 1997, C.I. 19. It provides:-

__paragraph__
“(5) The grounds of appeal shall set out concisely and under distinct heads of grounds upon which the appellant intends to rely at the hearing of the appeal without any argument or narrative and shall be numbered consecutively”.

__paragraph__
The ground (b) is argumentative and narrative and therefore it was contrary to law and procedure and same is hereby dismissed. See Akiwiye v Agyekum \[1984-86\] 1 GLR 179 C.A.

__paragraph__
Now, to ground (a) that the ruling was erroneous in law and amounted to a wrongful exercise of discretion. Arguing this ground, learned Counsel for the appellants referred to Crentsil v Crentsil \[1962\] GLR 171 at 175 C.A. to support his contention that it was settled law that an appeal against the exercise of a lower court’s discretion can only succeed if it can be established that the lower Court misapprehended the facts and thereby exercised its discretion on wrong or inadequate materials or gave weight to irrelevant or unproved matters. He submitted that by virtue of the Supreme Court judgment and the Land Title Certificate, the appellants had acquired a guaranteed title unless otherwise directed by a Court of competent jurisdiction. He referred to Chantel v Koi \[2010\] 34 MLRG 150 at 161 C.A.

__paragraph__
Order 25 rule 1(1) of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 2004, C.I. 47 provides the procedure for dealing with interlocutory injunctions. The order is as follows:-

__paragraph__
“(1) The Court may grant an injunction by an interlocutory order in all cases in which it appears to the Court to be just and convenient to do so, and the order may be made either unconditionally or upon such terms and conditions as the Court considers it just”.

__paragraph__
Order 25 rule 1(1) thus gives discretionary power to the Court to grant an injunction where it deems it just and convenient to do so. Further, order 25 rule (2) requires a party to an action to apply for the grant of an injunction before or after the trial of the action whether a claim for an injunction was included in the party’s writ, counterclaim or third party notice. Order 25 rule 1(3) requires an applicant or a party seeking an injunction to attach a motion paper and its supporting affidavit, a statement of case setting out full arguments including all relevant legal authorities in support of the application. Moreover, a respondent who desires to oppose the application is obliged to file an affidavit in opposition as well as a Statement of Case setting out full arguments and the legal authorities to be relied on. In the instant appeal, both parties have complied with the stated procedure in order 25 rule 1 sub rule (3) and (4).

__paragraph__
The Courts have recently considered the dictum of Lord Diplock in American Cyananud Co. Ltd. v Ethicon Ltd. \[1975\] 1 All ER 504 HL as follows:-

__paragraph__
“The Court no doubt must be satisfied that the claim is not frivolous or vexatious, in other word, that there is a serious question to be tried”.

__paragraph__
See also Vanderpuye v Nartey \[1977\] 1 GLR 428 C.A.

__paragraph__
Further, in granting interlocutory injunctions the Court takes into consideration not only the existence of a legal or equitable right of the applicant, but whether on the balance of convenience, the applicant would suffer irreparable injury or greater harm which could not be adequately compensated for in damages. A determination of the said principles involves a consideration of the pleadings and the affidavit before the Court. See Owusu v Owusu-Ansah and Anor. \[2007-2008\] SCGLR 870 Holding 1 as follows:-

__paragraph__
“(1) the granting or refusal of an injunction is at the discretion of the trial court but that discretion ought to be exercised judiciously …. The fundamental principle in applications for interim injunction is whether the applicant has a legal right at law or in equity, which the court ought to protect by maintaining the status quo until the final determination of the action on its merits. This could only be determined by considering the pleadings and affidavit evidence before the court”.

__paragraph__
It was also held in Odonkor and Others v Amartei \[1987-88\] 1 GLR 578 Holding 1 as follows:-

__paragraph__
“(1) the basic purpose of interim orders, was as much as possible to hold the balance evenly between the parties, pending a final resolution of matters in difference between them and also to ensure that at the end of the day the successful party did not find that his victory was one or one that brought him more problems than blessings”.

__paragraph__
In the instant appeal, the learned trial judge granted the respondents’ application by restraining both parties. I agree with the trial judge. It is noted that the respondents by their pleadings claim that the land is their ancestral property and that the appellants are on the land in dispute as licencees. The appellants have also claimed that by a Supreme Court judgment, they had been declared the owners and are in possession.

__paragraph__
However, the respondents have by their reply stated that they had no notice, neither were they parties or privies to the matter in the Courts. Further the exhibits OS1 to OS8 attached to the affidavit in support of the motion for injunction indicate that there are developments on the land in dispute in the nature of buildings being put up thereon. It is further noted that the appellants by their paragraphs 4 and 5 of the affidavit in opposition (supra) stated that the respondents failed to substantiate their allegations and that the attached exhibits have no probative value. They also deposed to the fact that the said exhibits established no link to them. The said paragraphs indicate that the appellants had nothing to do with the developments on the land in dispute and have therefore denied knowledge of those developments. Since the appellants have not denied that the developments on the land were not on the ascertained boundaries of the land in dispute, they would have nothing to lose if the injunction was granted. I entirely agree with the trial judge on his findings on this. It is trite that a person in possession of land could be restrained by injunction from using the land, see Yakubu II v Abdulai II \[1984-86\] 2 GLR 231 S.C. It is therefore right that the trial judge injuncted the parties despite the possession of a Supreme Court judgment by the appellants, especially when the appellants have denied the developments on the land in dispute. It is trite that res judicata could be proved by the adduction of evidence – see Moasa Co. v Scara \[1999-2000\] 1 GLR 538 C.A. Holding 1. In the instant case, the judgment in the possession of the appellants could only be proved by adducing evidence to establish any relevance of it to the land in dispute and the respondents. On the balance of convenience, the respondents would suffer greater harm which should not be adequately compensated for in damages if those buildings were to continue on the land.

__paragraph__
Moreover, it is interesting to observe that both parties appear more concerned with the order of interlocutory injunction than the substantive suit itself and the order restraining them will redirect attention to the main action and to its early disposal. It is noted that this action is part-heard before the trial Court and the confirmation of the order for injunction would therefore speed up the trial.

__paragraph__
Furthermore, in accordance with Order 25 rule 9 of C.I. 47, the learned trial judge ordered the respondents bound to undertake to pay damages to the appellants if it turned out that at the end of the matter the respondents were not entitled to the order. Order 25 rule 9 provides:-

__paragraph__
“9(1) Where an application is made under rules 1 and 2 of this Order, the Court shall, if the application is opposed, require before making an order that the applicant shall give an undertaking to the person opposing the application to pay any damages that person may suffer as a result of the grant of the application if it turns out in the end that the applicant was not entitled to the order.

__paragraph__
(2) The giving of an undertaking required under subrule (1) shall be a precondition to the making of any order under rules 1 and 2 of this order.

__paragraph__
(3) Where an applicant gives the undertaking, the court shall at the end of the proceedings in which the undertaking was given assess the damages, if any, which the person who opposed the application has suffered and which the applicant is liable to pay and shall give such judgment as the circumstances require”.

__paragraph__
The respondents duly undertook to pay the damages as ordered by the trial judge to balance the scales of justice evenly to avoid any lose to the appellants should the respondents fail to make a case. In the end, the appellants could be adequately compensated in damages if the respondents lose the case at the trial court. See Ballmoos v Mensah \[1984-86\] 1 GLR 724 C.A. See also Republic v High Court, Koforidua; Ex parte Ansah-Otoo & Anor. (KOANS BUILDING SOLUTIONS LTD. INTERESTED PARTY) \[2009\] SCGLR 141; 144.

__paragraph__
I now consider whether the trial judge exercised his discretion wrongfully. In Sappor v Wigatap Ltd. \[2007-2008\] SCGLR 676, the Supreme Court held that:-

__paragraph__
“The well known and time honoured legal principle is that an appeal against a decision based on the exercise of a court’s discretionary jurisdiction would succeed in only those exceptional cases where in sum, the Judge failed to act, judiciously. The applicable principles are, an appellate court, would interfere with the exercise of discretion where the court below applied wrong principles or conclusions reached would work manifest injustice or aver that the discretion was exercised on wrong or inadequate material, arbitrary, capricious etc. Uninformed conclusions stand in danger of being reversed”.

__paragraph__
See also Owusu v Owusu-Ansah \[2007-2008\] SCGLR 870. In the instant case, the learned trial judge from the record of appeal, exercised his discretion judiciously by considering the pleadings and the affidavits and came to the right conclusion that both parties be restrained.

__paragraph__
The learned trial judge having rightly exercised his discretion and having considered the balance of convenience and that the respondents’ case was not frivolous and vexatious, the trial judge was right in restraining the parties and their agents, privies, assigns, workmen etc. from having any dealings with any portion of the land in dispute pending the determination of the suit. The ground of appeal fails.

__paragraph__
The appeal fails and it is hereby dismissed. Order of interlocutory injunction granted by the High Court, Land Division, Accra on the 29th day of July 2011 together with the consequential orders made are hereby affirmed.
